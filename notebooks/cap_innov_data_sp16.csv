","My Circle is the app that makes you join into a group of people who want to visit at a specific day the same place, as Museums – Concerts – Theatre – Cinema etc. The aim is to prevent crowding at the box office and individual tickets.
According to a quick research, studying the Italian theme parks network, (from Gardaland to the Acquario di Genova) we can easily notice that the individual tickets average price is 28€, instead groups average price is 21€. That is 25% discount off the single ticket sale price (estimate based on 6 theme parks).
All Members join the Group with their own credit card in order to guarantee the prospective payment. The amount will be blocked on the credit card, and the transaction will come to pass when the Group reaches the appropriate number of members; then all the members will receive their tickets by e-mail.
Groups allow people to save money and are a good way for companies to make purchases easier. Our strong point is an organized community looking for money-saving chance, using the same service with an average reduction of 25%, and a maximum of 35%. The Community, thanks to various My Circle offers, will be glad to use the app whenever is possible, for a single day visit as well as for a longer visit. The point is “together we can save money” ! The point of strength is the app usability and the chance to join a group to save money.

For the educators Remini improves communication with parents in private and simple environment. 
Educators document special activities, achievements, progress, interactions, milestones… 
They organize & share class materials.

For the Family Remini enables to save forever their child’s precious moments: milestones, height, creations, smiles,share with Family, and don’t miss moments when the child is in school.

Business Model
Our business model is composed of subscription model for parents/preschool teachers and ordering prints/merchandising related to the child. Recently Remini successfully tested these models. Targeted marketing is an optional model that will be evaluated at a later stage.

Current State
Remini has a working product in smartphones (ios, android) and the web, had a successful pilot in the Israeli market, with hundreds of daily active preschools and more than 30,000 Users. The amount of material uploaded per active user is more than twice in comparison to Facebook. Remini started expending internationally with endorsements  from several preschool organizations including ECE-RJ, USCJ, Chabad.
Remini has raised investment from Heli Bennun and Zohar Zisapel.

Competition
Remini has several competitors, in child photo albums sector charging subscription fee of 36-40$ (Keepy, Lifecake- which was recently acquired by Canon) and in the parent-teacher sector (Tadpoles, Kaymbu- charging 2.25$ per child per class monthly).

Imagine you could browse through your childhood memories and find with a snap of a finger your first steps, your first fallen tooth, your childhood drawings and funny quotes. 
Remini uniquely combines the ease of instant group messaging and sharing, with the long term storing and documenting which is done seamlessly. At any time there is an option to look back at all the special moments and memories and create beautiful slide shows, presentations, decorations and order prints with a tap of a finger.

Friends began posting on Oliver’s Facebook wall, showing their appreciation for the positive impact he had made on their lives. Inspired, Austin bought a box, a pen, and a pack of sticky notes. He then left this compliment box on a table outside his dorm – by the end of the box was overflowing with anonymous notes. It Brightened someone’s day each time they received an anonymous note, and it was even more fun to write them. We want to extend that feeling to as many people as possible.

Brighten gives you the superpower of anonymity, and lets you use it for something good. Make someone's day by writing nice things to your friends, family, and colleagues. Isn't it about time we use an app based on kindness? Studies in human psychology show that one of the most important controls of our behavior are the established norms within any given community. Brighten is the first anonymous online community based on positivity, appreciation, and kindness. Everyone has their own 'home feed' to see all the nice things their friends are saying to each other. Creative ways to use Brighten: give anonymous compliments, ask anonymous questions, share secret confessions, funny inside jokes, express feelings. We are also building our mobile SaaS enterprise version for positive reinforcement and constructive criticism within the workplace.

Merchants will be reluctant to switch - lose data ","Xooker is free to Consumers. Merchants also have free basic access through our “freemium” business model. They pay for enhanced services, including advertising, sponsorships, prepaid deals, and most importantly, targeted messaging options, refined with our analytics.

Once identified, BarrelFish's incentive engine gets the prospects to take a measurable action and provide specific feedback. That feedback and all other relevant data points are used to create an accurate lead score. Highest scored leads are delivered to clients' sales team while lower scoring leads that are interested, but not ready to buy, are automatically nurtured using BarrelFish software. 

BarrelFish software is in beta and with early adopters we have achieved a 10x industry average outbound direct marketing response rate.

Bottom line, we get our clients message heard. ","BlueKai - now part of Oracle's Marketing Cloud - http://www.bluekai.com/
BlueKai is geared towards enterprise client's and isn't a standalone SAAS and provides the data, but not the execution of outbound direct marketing.

Lattice Engines - http://www.lattice-engines.com/ Lattice Engines requires a third-party SAAS to execute marketing campaigns and their on-boarding process is very complex. Onboarding fees have been high as $50,000. ","We charge a one-time onboarding of $5,000. In addition to onboarding, our monthly subscription fee ranges from $399 to $999 depending upon amount of contacts and data needed. We fulfill and profit from margin on our incentives. Average client revenue is estimated to be $20,000 / year. 

We sell to mid-sized growth companies with higher dollar and margin, complex sales. Because of existing connections, we are initially targeting IT software providers that fit the aforementioned criteria. ","Initially, we are finding clients by targeting our existing relationships and ""BarrelFish-ing"" them (eating our own dog food). Initial sales efforts have yielded close to a 10% response rate with an anticipated close rate of over 50%. By focusing on partner channels, we anticipate the numbers of clients to scale quickly - if it works for one partner, chances are that the other partners will subscribe (ie: IBM alone has 10,000 partners, most of which are potential clients). ","Revenue ","Our initial solution was a lifestyle business using our software. We have been actively transitioning towards a SAAS because of the massive growth / scalability potential. Revenues for our lifestyle business were closing in on $500,000; however, revenues are down as a result of not focusing on that business. In other words, we have taken two steps back so that we can take a thousand forward. ","We are currently focused on sales of our existing early adopter solution which is a proven strategy and software that works. However, each client setup still requires developer effort to launch a new campaign. 

As such, as we continue to sell this solution to generate revenue and gain clients, our primary goal is to transition into a fully functional SAAS as soon as possible. The time required to accomplish this is solely a function of money. Our model works but what we need now is money to pay for additional developers to develop a completely automated onboarding process (with support provided to help clients onboard, as needed).

The sooner we can make the transition to a SAAS, the sooner we can scale. Raising funds will enable us to expedite that process and because our solution involves machine learning (gets better and better with time) it will allow us to create a bigger barrier to entry for potential competitors..

So, we put our heads together and concocted a plan: to convince our parents to allow us to attend university overseas, in Australia. 

The plan worked, but I had no financial support and had to work two jobs to pay the exorbitant international student fees. I'm proud of the fact that I managed to complete my degree with distinction.

","Karma has two main points of difference. The first is that it is focussed on a very specific, currently untapped niche: reviews about people. And the second is, for the first time on a social platform, the information about a person will not be created or vetted by that individual.

We provide solutions these 4 problems:
1.) Learning about a person. We currently have the following main options: Google, Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, or asking a mutual connection. With enough digging we may gather the data we need, but none of these solutions provide a simple snapshot of a person's reputation.
2.) Writing a positive review. We can thank someone publicly by tagging them in a Facebook post (just two days after writing this sentence, Facebook released their “Say Thanks” feature). This is a nice gesture, but as it is not public or searchable information, it has limited utility to the person being thanked.
3.) Writing a negative review. When someone has harmed us, we may wish to warn others. A friend of mine recently let his house out while he was overseas. When he returned he found that the tenants had left his home in a state of disrepair. My friends would liked to have warned others against engaging with the these people, but there is currently no way for him to do so.
4.) Leveraging your reputation. People leverage their reputations through word of mouth within a specific community. But what happens if we relocate to a different city or country, or change companies or industries "," ","We hope to have achieve the following by the end of the 12 weeks:
> Learn from smart, experienced entrepreneurs 
> Create and launch a MVP
> Build a network of friends and mentors
> Find a great programmer to join our team
> Get advice on our business model and marketing

Clyde’s role is business strategy, legals, financials, and marketing.

Dayne’s role is primarily technical and design related. He’s currently working on the design and features of our MVP, researching platform and language options, and hiring a programmer. ","2 founders ","This is our first startup. However, we both have experience taking ambitious projects from conception to launch. Most recently we had an idea to use our crazy family and Dayne’s standup character to create a comedy, mockumentary web series. We secured funding from Screen Australia, and completed the project earlier this year. The series culminated in a live comedy play where we sold out a 650 seat theatre and donated the proceeds to charity.

This is obviously an extraordinarily ambitious goal, but we believe it is possible, and we're committed to seeing it through.

We recently had a meeting with Stephen Parker, the Vice Chancellor of the University of Canberra. He loved the idea, and was positive about us using the university as an early test bed. Once we’ve created sufficient uptake within a community, it’ll be easier for the product to spread organically. ","Functional prototype ","We plan to hire a designer and specialist frontend developer in early January, and start building the system immediately thereafter. ","To launch our MVP.

Beyond that, if the data from our launch looks as impressive as I hope it will be, we’d like to raise about a million dollars to ramp up development and marketing.
 ","Our biggest challenge at the moment is finding a great programmer. While Dayne has a degree in computer science and worked as a games programmer, he has not been in the industry for 5 years and has little experience with web programming. 

However, we recently began a relationship with former Google and Quora software engineer, Manish Jain. Manish has offered to mentor us through our tech problems, and he’s assisting us in finding and hiring a suitable programmer.

Another big problem that we’ll soon face is getting early traction/adoption. It’s the dreaded “chicken and egg” problem that startups like ours inevitably have to overcome. We’ve thought a lot about this, and we’re confident that we have a strategy to break the deadlock:

> Create a powerfully emotive marketing campaign - Karma is a marketers dream.
> Think small - Identify a small community of our most likely early adopters, and launch a blitzkrieg marketing push aimed at getting significant uptake within the community as soon as possible. 
> Create a product that is intuitive, beautiful, and inspiring
> Be agile - leap, test, measure, and pivot fast - we plan to launch a MVP by April

We give entrepreneurs a distinct advantage by connecting them to the most relevant people and organizations based on their needs throughout their region and beyond, all while supporting and strengthening the ESOs that serve them.
XLR8 provides individual users access to a robust social online entrepreneurship community with an intelligent, proprietary matching engine that creates otherwise unlikely encounters and provides the best possible match for entrepreneurs, mentors, investors and resources across an expanded ecosystem. This reduces the capital burn rate, increases the likelihood for entrepreneurial success and allows for additional employment opportunities. ESOs purchase a portal for $1,000 per month that is free for their constituents to utilize, thus gaining analytic information of their users’ interactions and needs, visibility for their startups to angel investors and vetted mentors from across the country, a shared library of best practices, original and curated media content to support ESOs' local incubation efforts, effectual resource sharing with other organizations, event management for regional ""collaboratitions” as well as access to consultants and motivational speakers.

","Based on XLR8 users' roles, backgrounds and needs, our proprietary matching engine intelligently connects them while saving time, capital and resources. We supplement ESO efforts by adding online collaboration - something many communities are missing. XLR8 links users to a regional, national and ultimately global resource sharing network. ","Many initiatives seek regional collaboration: 805 Connect, SourceLink, regional chambers, Evis Thrive and regional event calendar websites. Although each of these efforts is valuable, nothing efficiently connects/matches individual users at the grassroots level. Initiatives are continuously stymied at natural and man-made borders, thus limiting user awareness of both people and resources near and far. Duplication is therefore inevitable among ESOs in programming, content creation, etc. ","Utilizing direct marketing techniques, we add one community at a time to the XLR8 network. The Community Champion pays $1000 per month, for which he or she can onboard his or her entire community. We also have a Freemium model in place that allows individual users to purchase additional media content and services from strategic partners. Moreover, we are working on corporate sponsorships and from public-private organizations. Users also share Facebook & LinkedIn contacts with us. ","Harnessing over 75 years of sales experience, our “master community builders” utilize direct marketing techniques where we call potential rural and urban clients setting up sales visits and ask for warm referrals in the process. Once several member communities are formed in a region, our sales team connects to the next hub region. For additional publicity, we attend local entrepreneurship events, journal our travels and reach out to prospective communities and users on social media. ","Non-revenue customer traction ","We have about 50 communities who are exploring to launch with us in the first quarter of 2015. 60% of the groups we meet agree to launch with us, 25% say they will wait until after the initial launch to join, and 15% do not accept the opportunity at any level of membership.

With the market as of now, we stand to make a significant amount of money from selling to high school’s around the world. As we grow however, we are poised to go from simply high school and college, to college and grad school, grad school to the job market and beyond. 
 ","We intend to find customers by working and partnering with high schools. In addition, we would also like to partner with universities. By partnering with high schools, we not only get a good insight into what the students are looking for, but we get access to a large pool of students. With respect to the universities, we can provide yet another avenue for reaching prospective students. As it stands right now, we have one university and five high schools interested in paying for our service.  ","Non-revenue customer traction ","With non-revenue customer traction, we have had several high schools agree to help us test our service.

","Integrative medicine gives cancer patients and survivors alike the tools to proactively improve their lives, from physical health to mental well-being. By fostering positive changes in diet, physical activity and stress management, our approach strategically complements conventional cancer treatment. 
Currently, there is no technology available to address the aforementioned needs, nor is there a solution designed to properly equip the average person in their personal fight against cancer. The products that do exist are generic, static, and overwhelm users with information.
Our app, AntiCancerMe, provides dynamic, authoritative information — including dietary advice, exercise plans, and stress management tools — specifically tailored to the individual user.
Unlike other generic health fitness apps, AntiCancerMe only caters to people affected by cancer. All too often these individuals, in their quest for improved health, find themselves mired in the excess of information (and misinformation) available on the internet. AntiCancerMe delivers appropriate, customized information to the user at exactly the right time of day, based on the user’s particular situation. A team led by expert in integrative medicine curates the information effectively leaving the user with a virtual integrative medicine doctor. ","The iOS app is available via TestFlight. To view in TestFlight please provide an email address. ","By partnering with Capital Innovators, we hope to take our startup to the next level.

Here is the team intro: http://youtu.be/RzGZm5lc_iA  ","2 founders ","Mike: In March'13 I started Frescape.com, a free home exchange site to make the world a more convenient place. The idea was:  Spend less. Travel more. After raising a round of seed funding, I built a development and marketing team. In a few months Frescape became a fully-functional resource, compatible with all devices. Unfortunately, the site did not meet our ultimate expectations as it failed to generate enough exchange-ready users. Having said that, it was an incredibly valuable experience.  ","<6 months ","Dr. Deng: To maintain the authoritative nature of the product, I need to continue running a full medical practice and performing research in the field.

","Our top-priority is to build successful business and therefore we need a close proximity to top medical facilities.  St. Louis is a great location if we can build and grow the team there. ","- Our app targets a niche market. 
- There is currently no competitive product challenging our app.
- The information from the app is authoritative and trustworthy.
- The app tailors data to the user's specific state of health.
- The app is dynamic, adapting to the user's needs and progress over time. ","Currently there are no direct competitors. Of the myriad of health management apps currently available, none focus on cancer patients and integrative medicine. ","We will be reaching out to people affected by cancer. 20 million  people in the US has been diagnosed with cancer. There are 1.6 million new cases every year.
The business model:
- Free base app
- $19.99/month subscription for a “full” edition which allows for customization by treatment, side effects and disease type
- $39.99/month subscription for a “premium” edition which offers increased levels of personalization and greater interaction with care givers ","Employing a low-cost grassroots strategy, we plan to cultivate a user base by leveraging cancer patients as product testers. While testers nurture the market for our app by word-of-mouth we will partner with cancer patient support groups and national patient advocacy organizations to further intensify brand awareness. ","Alpha release ","The iOS application and web-based content management system are in beta. However, we very recently reached our most important milestone to-date: we began field testing AntiCancerMe with actual cancer patients.  ","By Mar'15 after addressing the initial feedback from beta users, AntiCancerMe will be released to the general public. At this time we will start building an awareness campaign centered on social media, cancer patient support groups, and national patient advocacy organizations.
We plan to further develop the product in two ways:
a) Content: By adding specific content for different cancers, treatments, side effects, etc.
b) Technology: Improve UX, making the app more dynamic and in-tune with everyday life. Sync the app to health trackers, iWatch and Apple's HealthKit.

How often were you in the middle of an important conversation with a boss, a friend, or a spouse, and again your phone died?

Our phones often die at the most inopportune places at the most inconvenient times, but there are no great alternatives for consumers to turn to today.

There are wired chargers, inductive charging pads, crowd solution products, and external battery packs. Inductive charging pads are thin matt-like objects that charge an electronic device only when placed directly on the pad. Crowd solution products being developed aim to be similar to WiFi but for power within a small office or room. Lastly, external battery packs are portable high capacity batteries.

Inductive charging pads and crowd solution products offer more power at inconvenient times, but not necessarily inopportune places because their systems rely on an outlet to function. Thus, these products are implemented in places where we normally still have access to power. This almost makes 'wireless charging' seem like an oxymoron since the products require a wire to use. Meanwhile, external battery packs are almost the opposite. External battery packs offer consumers more power at inopportune places or areas where consumers don't have readily access to power, but not necessarily inconvenient times. This is because the physical connection between the external battery pack and the electronic device can be cumbersome while on the move or we simply forget the battery state of our device due to multitasking.

Our product called the MotherBox is the first device that can babysit your phone for you! It has a rechargeable battery so it can offer additional power in a similar fashion to external battery packs, and it also has the ability to provide wireless power-on-demand! The MotherBox can sense the battery level of your device, turn itself on when needed, and wirelessly charge your device during use. For example, the next time you're in the middle of that important conversation and your battery drops from 10% to 5% the MotherBox can sense that change and begin seamlessly charging it. The user can then customize his or her experience via the mobile application.","We wirelessly charge electronic devices as they move freely at the moments and places you need them most.","API, Hardware-non-wearable",Prototype,"Total: USD 30000","3 Months"," ","B2C: Young Power Users - They utilize the product to charge their electronic devices at inconvenient places and times.;","No "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," ",Finalized,Josh,Yank,417134,Binghamton,"United States","I founded Yank Technologies in the hope to establish a wire free world.","Financial Modeling,Financial Analysis,Modeling,C++,Objective-C,Circuit Design,Screenwriting,Programming,Business Intelligence,Data Analysis,Electronics,Electrical Engineering,Software Engineering"," https://www.linkedin.com/profile/view?id=233217655&trk=nav_responsive_tab_profile",joshyank24@gmail.com,CEO," ","(845) 598 - 4648","Academic Achievements:

I graduated magna cum laude from University at Buffalo in three years with a B.S. in Finance, accolades from the Advanced Honors Program, and a 3.7 GPA. I graduated from Binghamton University a year later with an MBA with a Concentration in Business Analytics and Finance and a 3.8 GPA, making me the youngest graduate in the class and one of the youngest ever in the program.

General Accomplishments:

When I was eighteen, I wrote a screenplay called Crash of 29, and engaged in a contract with an Emmy-nominated producer for it. Last year, I invented a new financial product for investment banks called GBFs that entwines derivatives to money market funds in a new way. Furthermore, although my degrees are not in engineering, I have taught myself a great deal of electrical and software engineering, and consider myself experienced in high frequency power electronics and Objective-C. I’m an inventor at heart, and enjoy the challenge of creating the new and unexpected.

","We develop hardware architecture and communication systems that can safely and efficiently wirelessly charge electronic devices, such as smartphones and tablets, as they move freely. Our systems leverage resonant inductive technology, a highly efficient and safe wireless power transfer medium, in unique ways that allow us to overcome many challenges facing today's wireless charging systems.

Although resonant inductive technology allows slight misalignment of coils, it is still sensitive to the angular alignment between them. If the angle between your device and the wireless charging product is misaligned, your device may not charge well or at all. Furthermore, resonant inductive technology has difficulty charging multiple devices simultaneously if the transmitter coil isn't much larger than the receiving coil. Because few people would like to wrap a coil around their house and pay an electric bill equivalent to operating a power plant, this presents some additional problems.

With our first product called the MotherBox, we solve these major limitations. The MotherBox is a 4” x 4” portable wireless charging platform that is capable of charging devices within 1½’ to 2’ radius. With our unique coil geometry, the MotherBox is capable of enduring great coil misalignment, and with our communication system, we prevent magnetic distortion from multiple resonating receivers. For the first time, you can charge your phone as you walk to class, go to work, or kick back at your desk! ","www.yanktech.net ","By going through the program, we hope to connect with experienced entrepreneurs and mentors that have been through similar experiences. We not only hope to finish developing the MotherBox by the conclusion of the program, but also hope to learn and grow further as both a company and as individuals.  ","Josh Yank is the Founder & CEO. He has an MBA from Binghamton University and B.S. in Finance from University at Buffalo. Although his degrees are not engineering, he has taught himself a great deal of electrical and software engineering, and is experienced in high frequency power electronics and Objective-C. Furthermore, although he is the sole founder, he is not the sole contributor. This past summer, Josh promoted John Entrieri to Chief Engineer. John has a B.S.E.E. and is pursuing an M.S.E.E. ","1 founder ","Yes, Josh previously co-founded an entertainment company called Suave Gentlemen Enterprise in order to film the television pilot Organized Chaos, a television sitcom that revolves around the concepts of adolescent instincts and impulsivity. Josh not only directed more than a dozen actors on set, but also negotiated and conducted transactions with insurance companies and school districts. Furthermore, he developed things like cost analysis spreadsheets and Gantt charts on behalf of the firm. ","5+ years ","Josh has and will continue to work full-time for Yank Technologies. ","1 employee ","Yes - we can all attend "," "," The company will be based in whatever location is best for the firm after the program. ","Today's wireless charging products are almost all completely reliant on an outlet, and out of those that are moveable, none have a means of recharging itself wirelessly. This makes current ""wireless"" charging seem like an oxymoron since the product still requires a wire to use. The MotherBox is incredibly unique because it can wirelessly recharge with its solar cells and kinetic energy recharging accessories. Thus, you may never need to plug in your phone again and the wireless charging product! ","Our main competitors are experienced wireless charging firms that focus on mid-range wireless power transfer for consumer electronic solutions, such as WiTricity (http://witricity.com/) and Energous (http://energous.com/). However, these firms mainly apply their technology to home and office solutions, which have some serious drawbacks. The systems they are developing are completely reliant on outlet, can be enormous, potentially complex and expensive to install, and demolish your electric bill. ","We are open to manufacturing products on our own, entering a joint venture with an experienced manufacturer, or licensing our products to third parties. However, we are currently most inclined to enter a joint development agreement for the manufacturing of the MotherBox and license our transmitter design to auto manufacturers. For the MotherBox and the auto system, we would primarily obtain revenue streams from product sales, advertisement ads, and licensing fees. ","Our user base is predicated on the licensing, sale, and marketing of the MotherBox and vehicle systems. For the MotherBox, we have outlined a detailed marketing plan for the next three years. We will predominantly target two consumer segments called Young Traveling Businessmen and High School & College Students due to their accessibility, profitability, and the positioning of the product in their minds. We would be more than happy to share with you our market research. ","Functional prototype ","We have completed our first proof-of-concept prototype called the MotherBox for the consumer electronics segment, and are currently installing an upgraded communication system that allows immense user control and safety functionality. The entire foundation of the MotherBox application has already been completed along with the transmitter circuitry. ","Our next milestone is the completion of our communication system upgrade, which can be considered beta-level software. Our communication system is by far the most sophisticated ever made for wireless charging platform in order to offer consumers advanced control and safety. For example, we can conduct real-time temperature monitoring and create recommended charging periods to prevent overheating and overcharging of users' devices. The real-time temperature monitoring is crucial because many wireless charging products experience overheating issues when charging different devices or brands of devices. The recommended charging periods is very important because many users unintentionally diminish the useful battery life of their devices by charging them overnight. The recommended charging period would turn off the MotherBox when you're sleeping and your battery is near maximum capacity. We expect to finish the entire upgrade by the end of November, and are very excited about its potential. ","2013-12-16 ","We have not yet incorporated at this time. ","$7,000 ","$1000 ","N/A ","N/A ","In the future, we plan on raising money to purchase additional electrical equipment and expand our staff. With an external investment of at least four hundred thousand dollars, we are confident that we can have a market-ready model in less than a year. With an external investment of at least one million three hundred thousand dollars, we are confident that we can manufacture the MotherBox ourselves. We will be attempting to raise funds in several months.  ","Currently, our greatest challenge is to finish implementing our new communication system design. This has involved a great deal of programming on a multitude of different interfaces and languages. John and I have collectively written thousands upon thousands of lines of code, and are very confident we will finish the upgrade by the end of the month.

And unlike our competitors we directly care about our users; we want build the social skills needed by our users in order for them to make friends and prevent bullying. ","My competitors are Facebook, Meetup, and Eventbrite. The biggest one I fear is Meetup because it's service is dedicated to events. Though both are pretty weak as competitors since they don't fully understand what my users(13 - 29) want; especially Eventbrite since it's more of a recommendation service, instead of a social network environment. ","Nexrave will make money from affiliation, data mining, and selling spots(their events) at the top of a user's timeline in that area. In year 1, we will make money by mining useful data, such as what times of year do parties occur most; and sell it to big data-collecting companies or directly to the companies it matter most to. In year 2 we will introduce selling the event/party spot at the top of our users' news feed. ","We will get users by building awareness before the app launches so that when app launches, we have enough users to attract other users. Then we continue building awareness during and before certain times each year; ex: building awareness before spring break and/or summer vacation. This will attract users because this app would be particularly useful during those seasons.

Apple highlighted it as one of their year-end best-of apps and Starbucks selected it as one of their free apps of the week. Crate & Barrel also featured it as an app giveaway in their Spring catalog. It has been downloaded over a million times since its introduction in 2010.

This past year we began developing and selling a B2B iPad app called Pocketbooth Promo. Pocketbooth Promo enables companies to deploy branded photographic experiences either as kiosks or in brand ambassador assisted scenarios. The platform that underpins this app allows us to customize, deploy, and monitor these apps from a central web-based backend. Clients can opt to use the lead generation component of the app to gather and engage new customers and a rich analytics component allows the company to see how their customers are using and sharing the photos.

There are two related products we are working on.

The first is Pocketbooth Party -- it is a consumer-facing offering targeted at individuals who would like to have their own photobooth at a party or event but cannot afford a physical photobooth which can cost over a thousand dollars. This app will ship by year's end. 

The second is Pocketbooth Vend, an iPad-based kiosk available for bars, restaurants, museums, and 
theme parks that replaces the traditional photobooth with a modern and customizable photo vending machine. ","Here are 5 install codes for Pocketbooth on iOS. The B2B version of this app, Pocketbooth Promo can be demoed for you, but is a more involved installation and configuration process:

DaaSx removes the need for proprietary software, structured presentation layout, managed implementation and limitations for embedding multi-channel content.   Our SHOWCloud displays can be remotely configured and updated utilizing a co-browsing partner application. ","We generate recurring revenue through licensing our display as a service platform to businesses, partners and integrators.

We plan to form partnerships with national/international associations that support trade shows and conventions as well as vendor exhibitors.  Additional revenue streams will come through strategic partnerships and sponsors in wearable technology. ","We have been engaged by a multi-national manufacturer to support several trade shows.   By attending these events, we will identify new leads.   We will also work with digital agencies and associations to provide our solutions to their customers/members.

We visited booths at GraphExpo and discovered that digital exhibit displays ranged from static images and single videos to kiosk-driven PowerPoint presentations.  One analyst introduced us to several other exhibitors and agencies.  We are now scoping several major events to support.

We are in the process of submitting an application to participate in the Mock Angels Program.   We are presently partnering with another startup to integrate our platform with their bluetooth sensing device that will launch dynamic content on a display based on a button press or a triggered action monitored by beacons in a geo-fence.

","info@fundwok.com ","(415)799-7368 ","Seed-DB.com "," ","FundWok is an innovative online social community where resources are located and shared effectively and ideas and initiatives supported. ","Currently, FundWok  serves as a platform for people who have funds to give or buy services for to make them available and specify the amount and the criteria.

The long-term goal of FundWok is to promote free economy, so more features will be provided to enable easier exchange of resources between people. These include enable the 'funder' to give away services (which they can ask for something in return just like now), more payment options (currently it's just Paypal), and more versatile filters to be able to locate funds easier. ","fundwok.com ","What we hope to gain from the program is to lay grounds for FundWok to a few levels:
1. Infrastructure: While the intention is not to be comprehensive, we look for advice in terms of a manageable framework for startups at an early stage.
2. Network: We wanted to know if the investors are excited by this idea, and how to pitch FundWok effectively to the startup community which might needs to be different from the customers hear. We also wanted to discover FundWok's potential from peers.  ","Sonia Lin, Founder and CEO, is leading the tech development of FundWok as well as the operations. ","1 founder ","Yes.
Sonia previously co-founded a Chicago-based startup Kauzu, which was a location-based job search platform. Kauzu won the top prize of Gigabit Challenge, a Google-themed business competition held in Kansas City. Sonia went on raising the profile of the startup to international visibility, and was featured in a Google commercial along with the startup regarding the founding of Kauzu. ","  ","n/a ","2 employees ","Yes - we can all attend ","The two employees work as part-time consultants, one based in Chicago, and the other based in Mumbai. The team of three has been working remotely for 6 months with steady progress. ","Chicago ","Fundwok’s unique angle is that it gives funders the freedom to choose how much to give and what conditions to set to giving without any commitments. While sites like Groupon or Living Social help in business promotion, you need to sign up for monthly commitments, offer a large inventory and give a big commission. Fundwok doesn’t impose any of that. You can choose to spend thousands or just a few dollars. You can choose to fund hundreds of potential clients, or just the right one.  ","There are other online sites where businesses or individuals can purchases tangible goods or services, like Craigslist (craigslist.com), but that site leaves a lot to be desired. Craigslist charges for a businesses to list a job ad, while Fundwok doesn’t. Craiglist provides the funder’s e-mail address and phone number, and allows individuals to contact the funder. Fundwok requires both the funder and those that want to be funded to register for accounts and list their identifying information. ","10% commission is charged on top of each transaction (whenever the funder selects the applicant). 
The current target is individuals and small business owners who are looking to hire help, encourage initiatives, or like exploring/sharing great deals. ","Currently we find them through online market place such as fiverr.com which is a good microcosm of our target audience -- who have diverse needs either with business or gifting, and want to do it with an affordable and efficient way without commitment.  ","Non-revenue customer traction ","The metric we're looking at now is how much it costs to acquire customers, how often do the customers come back, and how long their lifecycle is on the website.  ","The next milestone of FundWok would be revenue-positive, which is planned be reached in 6 months.  ","2014-07-23 ","C-Corp ","$3000 ","$500 ","$0 ","$0 ","$250,000 in 6 months ","1. Tell needs from wants: customers give a lot of feedback, some of them really helpful, some of them bells and whistles, so there are quite a few decisions to make in terms of what to focus on.
2. Customer acquisition: the customers are successfully acquired to join the site usually fall into a certain profile -- the ones that are in tech or marketing which seem to be early adopters. While this tendency isn't entirely surprising, we are trying to make FundWok as approachable as possible to discover more potentials. "," "," ","Chicago ","IL ","U. S. A.

We believe anyone can build whatever he needs, once they have pieces they know how to build with. If someone can define what he wants, he should also be able to create that, all other irrelevant details should not be getting in the way.
We've finished the prototype and made a lot of demo videos on ELFblocks.com. ","www.ELFblocks.com ","Avoid common mistakes, get connections, get founding, scale. ","Matija is mostly responsible for hardware part, while Domagoj mostly for software and management - but we're working on almost everything together.

","We're first to market.
We're attacking a lot of traditional manufacturers of electronic devices, since ELFblocks can produce almost anything, even fully functional Turing machine.
Since this is not 'software only', we can get patent protection. ","- LittleBits.com allow user to connect electronic parts without soldering iron, but their user has to be an expert, while ELFblocks are for everyone.
- WunderBar (relayr.io/wunderbar) is a new startup that produces limited set of sensors, but their user need to be Smartphone App Developer, unlike for ELFblocks (which can also connect to smartphone).
 ","We make money by selling blocks to consumers (do-it-yourself enthusiasts).
Internet of Things market is growing - people need smart gadgets, and with ELFblocks they can produce custom smart gadgets on their own.
 ","Since users will be creating configuration on their own, we'll have huge a boost from them bragging over social media. We make users feel in power and creative - so they'll share their own success very aggressively.
Existing companies that sell electronic parts expect the users to be smart, and end up making average user feel stupid. We can make average user feel smart, creative and in control.

 ","Our only competitor is a Chinese startup named Handy (http://handy.travel) that has developed over the past two years in Hong Kong with excellent results (21M fundraised).

Moreover their phones only support Chinese and English Language. ","Our business model will initially focus on business customers, hotels. These will have a smartphone fully customizable that, in addition to all the features that will significantly improve the travel experience for the guests, will be equipped with a phone card that will allow them to make unlimited domestic and international calls and surf the web without limits and at no additional cost.

","daniel@zetuniverse.com ","+7.903.260.8379 ","Other ","Scott Bernstein reached out to us by email. ","Zet Universe is a visual dashboard that integrates project information for PMs struggling with too many projects ","Project Managers have to be in control of their projects; existing software stores information in separate silos, so projects live only in PMs’ heads. Forgetting things leads to cascade failures within PMs’ organizations. To avoid that, PMs spend about 4 hours a day to get the most current project status, but failures still happen. Zet Universe allows PMs to keep track of their project information.

Zet Universe is in many ways unique as it allows customers to continue using services they use instead of switching to another project management solution (which is usually offered in these cases). Zet Universe by its nature is similar to Google as smart indexer that builds knowledge graph of users' projects, and similar to Palantir Workspace as it allows users to connect and visualize data sources to organize data by projects.

From user perspective, Zet Universe is a visual dashboard. It shows all project information from various sources in one place. Zet Universe provides a combination of intuitive visual metaphor, familiar manually and automatically extracted IF-THIS-THAN-THAT (IFTTT-like) rules, and semantic extraction to define project information boundaries. Those boundaries are used to automatically classify incoming information by user's projects.

Visual dashboard provides users with ability to see a high level view of their projects, as well as to quickly zoom into each project's details when needed. ","N/A (we can show it via Skype Screen Sharing session) ","1. Finish building Zet Universe beta on top of Office 365 and ship it to our users. 
2. Prepare to the Microsoft Ignite in Boston in May'15, to deliver a talk and attract new business customers.

Years in Business	Number of Parents 	Cost per Parent	Total Amount Generated
1	45,080	$100	$4,508,000
2	209,000 new, 94,500 renewal	$100	$29,743,000
3	360,000 new, 264,000 renewal	$100	$61,152,000

While there are custody calendars available at varying costs from $5 to $150 per parent, per year, Kindred United, will offer features not currently available, not the least of which will be a strong level of customer and technical support.  We believe, as the parents become comfortable with the ease and convenience of our service, not only will they appreciate the services, but will realize that the value provided is well worth the fee.  Not only will they be anxious to renew, this will be a program they will readily recommend to their friends.

We sell photobooks with ad placements to tourists on high emotion trips.

We're faster with higher quality. 

We increase traffic to destination gift shops when customers pick up the book.

We incorporate trivia into a scavenger hunt application that is completed with photographs, thus curating them.

We make software for the mobile applications and order processing to build the books from customer photographs.

We make the ""print stations"" that store the material, printers, backup power, assembly unit and computer in a 2' x 4' footprint. (2 printers). One std pallet stores 1600 books and is easy to operate. We created a book in 5 minutes. Faster printer will bring that down to 2. Print stations can be installed like legos - museums, cruise ships, etc.

Print stations do not require a photo lab and have no special power or environmental requirements.

Desire for scavenger hunt ""completionism"" increases per capital revenue for destinations by strategically creating a scavenger hunt path with a desirable vistor pathway. Example: Sending a visitor to the planetarium side of the St Louis Science Center increases per cap revenue by as much as $10.

The print station is the core. Each component of our system is ""loosely coupled."" For example can integrate with other photo applications. We will store the photographs, have the customer account and manage the ad buys. The ad algorithm is setup with vision to integrate w/ Google AdWords type services.

He's considered an owner and operational advisor.  ","TBD depending on what makes sense financially - taxes, market and production proximity etc. Mark will always live in STL. I'm flexible. ","Speed, quality, content and focus. 

We put travel-sized books in customer's hands before they leave the destination. 

We cut the elapsed time from a memorable experience to receiving a book from weeks to minutes.

Our algorithm dynamically creates content based on photo metadata. 

We provide value to destinations by increasing time on site and more traffic to gift shop therefor increasing per capita revenue.

We are working on a worldwide exclusive for the travel-sized cover technology. ","Shutterfly: online photobook creation. Too long to curate photos and book is rec'd weeks after the experience. Walgreens & Retail: online photobook creation. Too long to curate photos, available same-day but quality is sub-par. Groovebook: $2/mo subscription for 1 book/mp. Up to 1 mo after memorable experience, no content. Image Group: Disneys photo co. Photogs and on-ship photo gifts. Lg footprint photolab req's trained employees. Wildlife Trading Co: destination retail mgr. No ads or content. ","Selling books and ads.

Books are sold to tourists on packaged tours or visiting sci ctrs/zoos/nat'l history museums with photo opps.

The higher the emotional value of the trip, the more we charge. (aside: in our previous finalist presentation an objection was raised about paying $30 for a 8.5x11 book for the St Louis Science Ctr. The objector is not our customer. We focus on tourists, not locals, and admittedly STLSC doesn't have high emotional value. We also now produce a 4x6 travel size.)

 ","The founders have extensive ""rolodexes"" in the relevant industries to reach 1) destination partners 2) and associations...

...which then leads destination partners who will do on-site promotions

...which they are willing to do because of our value proposition and quality

Word of mouth. Especially on cruise ships when we have a contained market for 7 days. ""oh wow what a lovely book, where'd you get it?""

Books lend themselves to gifts, furthering our reach.

Bookshelf & conversation pieces.

 ","Revenue ","We sold ad space for Missouri destined books for $1 / book with $100 cap to the Missouri Humanities Council. 

This tested book creation and our algorithm for custom content. 

We have a completely functional system with the book making station. We are preparing another pilot at another location. ","Three Big Ones: Exclusivity, Patent and Pilot. 

Exclusivity: We are currently negotiating a worldwide exclusive on travel-sized form factor of the new cover technology. That's key. Next meeting is 11/20/14.

Patent: Our IP attorney indicates 2 elements of our system might be patentable. Application is underway and we have a notorized product description. 

Pilot: Working with a destination in Austin, TX to pilot book sales. They're independent which avoids the ""blocker"" we experienced with the science center (Wildlife Trading Company has a photo concession exclusive) and allows us to move quickly. They feature dinosaurs which has high impulse buy value for little kids. They do field trips and family visits. Planning underway, expect to start early December 2014. ","2013-11-01 ","LLC ","$82,000 ","$5k for expenses.  ","$125 ","$100 ","We look forward to your wisdom on this matter but here's our thinking. 

$1 million ASAP to augment team, commercialize products, negotiate long-term exclusive contracts with customers and for the technology - that's runway through end of January. Double that for 6 months.

Then $5mm+ to scale in Q2. Subsequent investment will depend upon amount of inventory we need to establish. 

We want to be a major player for the ""high season"" in Sept.  ","Enough money to launch this rocket ship and get to market and be a major player quickly. 

We want to partner with companies who have existing supply chain and destination contracts. Our product has to be rock-solid before we approach them so we're in a strong negotiating position.

Indeed, the platforms such as AWS, Azure, Google becoming more and more popular. But platform is not enough. Users want variety of tools to work with it. And BitCalm is excellent tool if we talking about backup problem.
We believe that our approach allows a lot of non-core specialists to easily manage disaster recovery, and to focus on core tasks for their service (eg software development) ","Enterprise solutions – are user-unfriendly and are pretty expensive for the targeted segment. 
Hosting-providers solutions – doesn’t fit small projects due to unavailability of incremental copying, hard limit for size of the backup, inability to choose the version of the backup. 
In-house made scripts – require special competences and are very time-consuming, which leads to failures of recovery and data loss.

","We testing and analyzing different traffic channels: social networks, advertising in google and bing, publications on specialized technical resources, startups catalogues, partnership with technical conferences and other events. 
Also we working on attracting customers through partnerships with hosting providers and the various services that might be used by our potential customers.

- 500 registrations;
- 25 sales;
- $300 revenue; 

Main our metric is people who installed our client to their servers. ","The next important milestone for us - the steady increase of paying users of the product and also raising conversion from registrations to those who installed the bitCalm agent to their servers.
To do this, we are now working on improving user experience, testing traffic channels to attract users, developing new product features and creating the best of its kind backup service for our customers.
Each of the three aforementioned areas of activity requires thorough approach and time. We plan to reach the stable growth of about 5-6 months.

Athletic consumers are still reluctant to make purchases online, but in-store sales are largely supported by unqualified store associates, which leaves consumers in the dark. We produce engaging product-focused content (including a real-time database showing product usage among professional athletes), and we have built an advanced database and digital concierge that will give athletes accurate, data-driven product recommendations, based on verified product attributes and reviews submitted by experts and community members.

In many ways, we're also the TripAdvisor for athletic footwear and equipment. We are the first company to provide aggregated price and feedback data specifically for sporting goods consumers. We've engaged the product blogger community to aggregate reviews for every product in our database, and we have the capability to semantically analyze all of this feedback data to give consumers a concise snapshot of public sentiment on a specific product. We're also starting to produce high resolution product photography and HD video product overviews to give athletes the information they need before making a purchase.

For too long, consumers have been forced to tediously search through countless retail domains in order to curate, research, and price compare the products they use in their athletic pursuits. The mission of Tackl.com is to deliver maximum transparency and user experience to sporting goods consumers, resulting in better informed purchase decisions and greater engagement levels for all stakeholders.

We will centralize the entire universe of athletic products onto a single infrastructure and design features that specifically cater to the needs of a performance and style-focused athletic community. Our platform will enable users to browse and compare all available products, regardless of the brand affiliation or retail channel. Content will be rigorously quality-controlled and the platform will be highly collaborative - encouraging and incentivizing honest, unbiased, and high quality feedback and participation from a passionate community.

The beta version of the platform will be re-launched during the first week of December 2014, followed closely by some major navigational updates and a redesigned Product page interface that includes a new 3-tier review aggregation format.

Additionally, we are keenly aware of our shortcomings, and are hoping to get valuable strategic advice that will help us to avoid mistakes and missteps often made by early-stage companies, leading to greater efficiency in our spend and optimized market fit for our products.

","Shortly after the launch of our beta platform, we will launch a strategic marketing campaign, the main aspects of which are: social media (including an industry data/analytics/infographics campaign); live event marketing (various amateur sporting events and conferences); an ""elite"" product tester program (similar to Amazon's Vine program); and strategic partnerships with brands, retailers, and their more prominent advocates.

The Stated Home is an e-commerce website that will only offer products that are made in America which will benefit both the environment and the economy. In addition to promoting American manufacturing, we will make furniture shopping easier, more transparent and less overwhelming for consumers. The Stated Home will achieve this by offering a curated selection of quality furniture and producing content aimed at guiding the customer through selecting the best furnishings for their lifestyle and tastes.

To combat the economic and environmental impact of overseas furniture manufacturing, consumers must buy more American-made goods. We plan to promote this by effectively demonstrating why consumers should purchase these items over those produced overseas. We will feature the manufacturers through video and written content aimed at telling their story, highlighting the furniture benefits, and explaining what makes these pieces quality. By educating consumers with the stories of the manufacturers and showing where their dollars are going we will keep and grow manufacturing jobs in America.

In order to effectively sell furniture, we must make the process less overwhelming to consumers. We will accomplish this by orchestrating an online shopping experience different than any that currently exist. We will:
-Offer styles and fabrics pre-selected to be timeless yet stylish
-Produce written and video tutorials on how to determine comfort

Shopping for furniture is often overwhelming since existing furniture stores offer hundreds of different options per category of good (ie sofas). The Stated Home will offer a curated selection of furniture in versatile styles from only the best manufacturers. There will be written and video content to highlight the benefits of our offerings as well as tutorials on how to figure out the best style and fabric for the customer.

Consumers don’t know what to consider when looking for comfortable furniture and comfort is impossible to determine when shopping online. We will create a comfort rating system and a series of written and video tutorials to explain what to think about when determining if a piece of furniture will be comfortable. In addition, individual furniture styles will have videos of comfort “testers” sitting on and talking about how the piece feels to further eliminate this barrier to online furniture shopping.

There is no centralized source for consumers to find stylish, high- quality American-made household goods. I will identify American manufacturers that offer on-trend furniture styles.

Hello,

I represent Capital Innovators, a top ranked seed investment fund and accelerator program. We're really impressed by everything you've done with VeriQuik, and we think you could be a great fit for our program.  Our applications are currently open for the Spring 2015 cohort, and we encourage you to apply.

Please let me know if you have any questions, and you can find more information at capitalinnovators.com.

Sincerely,

Suhani Fernando | Associate

","VeriQuik is a proactive platform where users can quickly establish, authentic, validate, and verify their identity; or send a request to someone else so they can verify themselves, prior to meeting for the first time.

- Charles Oliver was charged with 3 counts of sexual assault, 3 counts of unlawful restraint and 1 count of harassment of a witness in Woodstock, Illinois. He met 6 different victims on Craigslist.

- Dr. Thomas Brey was sentenced to 25 years for rape, sodomy, strangulation and the assault of Jennifer Bennett in Bend, Oregon. They met on Match.com, and he had a previous charge of sexual assault.

Unfortunately, these are just 2 of countless stories of horrific acts of violence and other criminal activity perpetrated upon unsuspecting victims; in which the victim met the attacker via the Internet. Human beings innately recognize their basic need for safety and personal security, but with the advent of the Internet, we have largely sacrificed this most basic need for the sake of
speed and convenience.

With VeriQuik's quikIQ technology and QuikScreen process, we allow users a measurable tool to mitigate risk before meeting someone for the first time. For pre-employment screening needs, our automated system via API easily integrates into any users existing site or HRIS system.

The Kansas City startup community has labeled VeriQuik as the ""Carfax for People""!

 ","http://veriquik.com ","We want to achieve greatness!

We Want to Work Together - Although we are all doing different things, we want the cohort to operate as one.

We Learn Together - We're dedicated to constant learning. That's why we surround ourselves with industry leaders, so we can share their experiences and wisdom. From CEOs to other startups around the country, these leaders always have something invaluable to teach us.

Unfortunately background checks can be costly for employers, or sites like LinkedIn and Match.com. It's not always feasible and cost effective for them to conduct screens on their users. With VeriQuik it is! VeriQuik can easily be integrated into ANY system, and background checks can be quickly conducted.

VeriQuik solves the unknown for our customers, and takes out the guesswork! ","VeriQuik hopes to be the background screening authority for the dating and sharing economy.

Our competition is: www.beenverified.com and www.instantcheckmate.com

Although....

Unlike those sites that access public record data dumps, VeriQuik performs REAL voluntary background checks. Due to legal and regulatory compliance, this is the only true way to complete a criminal history check. Our permission-based model allows the end user to be the gatekeeper of his or her own information. ","We make money selling background checks to our users via C2C and B2B.

 ","1) Boots on the ground. Ultimately we would like to hire some remote sales people and we're not afraid to aqquire customers the old fashion way. Pick up the phone, email, or walk right in the front door.

2) Corporate Partnerships

3) Organic Marketing Campaigns

4) Non-organic Marketing

4) Success Stories

5) Whatever it takes.

* For C2C, our revenue model is amazing! It's free for business like Match.com and optional for their users. Also, the intent is to pay them per user who signs up. ","Public beta release ","VeriQuik launched in March when we graduated from the BetaBlox.com accelerator. We just wrapped up the inaugural K-State LAB program: goo.gl/cpF8DE.

According to USA Today, billions are spent on online dating. So much, there are no metrics to gather the data.

- Corporate partnerships in these industries are the focus. Our API can be easily integrated into there current user sign-up forms.

We've taken what other companies do & completed a paradigm shift. Although these companies are great for some permissible purposes, we’ve found they often provide users with a false sense of security.

Focus on the API for: Match.com, LinkedIn, Airbnb, E-Harmony, Plenty of Fish, Tinder, etc.

The plan is to be accepted into the 6th best startup accelerator in United States, and take part in the Spring 2015 Cohort.

Soon after, we plan on being the 41st company in Capital Innovators portfolio to increase the $95MM raised after graduation! ","Our biggest problems are development and access to mentors.  Up to this point, we have entirely bootstrapped our startup.  With the assistance of Capital Innovators, I truly believe we will be able to get where we want to go and more!  We need help from the experts regarding: user education, marketing, content development, market strategy, and raising capital.

VeriQuik can provide safety and security to both the underserved and elderly community. Often times these groups are targets and become victims of crimes. By using VeriQuik prior to hiring a contractor or vetting them through our system, can prevent them from becoming a victim of a scam or fraud.

With decades of combined law enforcement, personal safety and security experience, we possess the passion to doggedly pursue the preservation of human life. We strive to do this through the development of a platform where users can quickly establish, authenticate, validate and verify their identity.

Goal: mitigate risk to keep people safe, build a successful startup,
provide employment opportunities, give back to the community through mentorship and philanthropy.

The beauty of learning alongside and from like-minded individuals in one’s community is an entirely different experience.

Dabble attracts people with a lifelong learning mentality - those who are interested in expanding their mind, cultivating experiences and relationships and exploring new horizons. Our experience and data since launching in 2011 shows the growth opportunity is significant.

Fairket offers a unique 'Rent To Own' model, where consumers are charged strictly on a usage based and get to own an app after sustained usage. Rental charges for all apps are deducted from a prepaid credit balance, which consumer can top up either with hard money or ad funded free credits. Developers unlock revenue potential by offering premium app experience at compelling usage pricing. Fairket app is an App Rental Market, where consumers can discover all rentable apps in one place.

These methods are typically done by one or two people contracted by a family at a cost over $1,000. These methods take editing and production skills and take a lot of time. Also, this process doesn't necessarily include people outside of the production team. Granvu is a social media app that allows an older loved one to answer one question at a time through a tablet making the software a self editor. The app also encourages friends and family to ask questions and start a dialogue with older loved ones. The system has built-in questions that a user can answer or ask and also allows the users to enter their own questions. Overall, Granvu is an easy way to answer life's most important questions and save them for future generations.  

There are benefits to a seniors' housing company for using Granvu as well. Staff can ask residents a question to get to better know them which will create good will among staff, residents and family.

","StickyPop is a social platform where users can create and name virtual news feeds ""Spots"" at their current location.  The trick is that only users whom are physically at that ""Spot"" can see and comment on the content posted to the spot (Pics, videos and text). This makes the posted content visibly limited by the Spot's geographical location (i.e. A user can only create, see, post and comment if they are physically there).  

Most platforms ""push"" posted content out to anyone that is a user of the platform.  StickyPop ""narrows"" and limits visibility of posted content to a specific location.  Making StickyPop a social platform that is exclusive location.  Our goal is to provide a completely new system that people will use to better connect and share with others in their direct environment.  

For example, imagine you are a college student out with your friends at a local bar/club/venue. There is currently no way for you to virtually connect with others at that venue.  You open StickyPop and immediately see what other people at that venue (or who have been there before) have posted, while remaining completely invisible to others until you post to that Spot.

Bob’s first startup was in high school and since then has developed start-ups in different areas in the US, Germany, UK, Sierra Leone and the Netherlands.  Grant started two businesses (freemedlist.com and raidertraders.com) during college that aimed to connect college and medical students with the intent of selling and buying used textbooks from each other.

","2 employees ","Yes - we can all attend ","n/a ","Austin, Texas ","Other location-based messaging services do not get how to provide the right level of privacy to users while increasing the value of posted content. Both factors are key for successful location-based information services. The StickyPop system focuses on a feed at a specific location, making the content relevant to where the user is right now. Our “Opt-In” system allows users to stay completely invisible until they post. Users are not anonymous, which provides an accountability of posted content ","YikYak - provides completely random posts in a general area. We focus on posts at a specific location, making our content more relevant, legitimate and valuable. www.yikyakapp.com

MeetMe - displays and connects users by profiles. We create public communication at a spot, keeping users invisible until they post (increasing privacy and control). www.meetme.com/

Whisper - posted information has no relevance to specific location, situation, or person, decreasing the value to users. 
 ","Our company plans to eventually allow businesses to purchase ""certified"" spots.  These spots will have a distinct color and act as ""virtual billboards"" to customers who are in or near their venue.  Businesses will have the ability to push advertisements to the top of a spots newfeed. Essentially the business now will have the ability to converse and engage with on-site customers and create an exclusive environmental customer experience.   ","Our marketing efforts will focus on locations where people will have a specific reason to express their negative or positive feelings - sporting events, entertainment venues, and on-campus activities. 

Our initial launch of the product is planned in Austin, Texas during SWSW 2015. Why? Because we believe the tight college culture combined with the strong social scene will allow us to reach our target audience, through sponsored community events and promotions, while keeping costs lean. ","Functional prototype ","We are currently developing a releasable product, building a network of interested investors out of the Harvard iLab, and preparing our initial launch marketing plan.       ","Our next milestone is to finalize an alpha release.  We are scheduled to complete alpha Jan. 15th.  This milestone is essential because we need to have a launchable product by March 1st in order to launch at SWSW 2015 (second weekend of March).

","The ""chicken and egg"" - As a geo-social network startup the greatest challenge is to reach community critical mass and obtain viral user base growth.  With a limited marketing budget, our current efforts are in finding the appropriate growth hacking tactics for our system. We need foster the growth of our user base with in app features that allow for users to push our product to other users while adhereing to our privacy and limited visibility of posted content commitments.  

We believe that younger social media users are moving away from traditional platforms because they fear that they will be judged by their parents, grandparents and future employers for what they post.  This creates a dilemma in that Facebook and Twitter can be leveraged for viral growth, but we still want to create a distance from those platforms in order to foster younger users to post without fear.

Our platform will pair with any wearable heart rate device through bluetooth, including smart-watches.  In addition to heart rate, DataDog tracks location, movement, and subjective emotional input to generate a stress profile for the user.  

If a user gets fed up with his boss at work and his stress levels increase, the DataDog app will send his phone a notification. Not only will the notification remind him of his emotional state, it will provide ways for the user to reduce stress. If the user doesn't  engage with DataDog  in that moment, he can address the notification any time afterward. Later, when the user is home or with his therapist, he can sign into the DataDog web portal and view when and where his stress levels were increased. He can then schedule exercises and set goals for the future.

The set of tools that DataDog app and web portal provides allows users to identify personal triggers and establish helpful stress management strategies with or without a therapist. Therapy options include cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT), a clinically validated tool which challenges the user to dispute their anxiety-producing beliefs. The exercises also include mindfulness based stress reduction another validated stress relief tools.

DataDog is a companion for people with stress and anxiety. It will know when you are stressed and help you get through it.

Unlike our competitors, our approach is device and platform agnostic, enabling our company to grow with the ever-changing wearable technology market.  Additionally, we provide evidence-based tools and our advisors are clinical leaders in the field.  We target anxiety disorder patients, which adds clinical validity to our consumer-facing stress app. Our competitors focus on fitness and general wellness. ","Monetization is based on a ""freemium"" subscription model. We allow the user to download our app for free with heart rate tracking functionality and limited therapeutic exercises. We charge subscription for service features that include record keeping, heart rate alerts, enhanced therapeutic offerings, scheduling and goal setting. Our customers are people with anxiety disorders, people who want to reduce stress, or people who are interested in self-tracking their mental health ","An initial release and test group will be a patient population at Barnes-Jewish Hospital.  We will simultaneously reach out to our therapeutic contacts in St Louis for a controlled release and testing phase. We will subsequently market through therapists and online.  Publication in journals and appearance at psychology/psychiatry conferences will connect us to more therapists to win recommendations, while web marketing will bring in a wide population of users. ","Functional prototype ","The app currently connects, via bluetooth, to the Zephyr and Polar heart rate chest straps. Once connected, DataDog displays heart rate and related statistics.  The DataDog algorithm can separate stressful moments from other situations that raise one's heart rate. We are currently collecting data from friends and optimizing stress detection. We have collected  6 months of user data. ","Our next milestone is to obtain our first 10 sub-clinical customers and commence a clinical pilot study. We expect to achieve 10 customers by January 2015 and to commence our pilot study by Spring of next year.

We are pursuing both a clinical and sublinical app simultaneously. Sub-clinical stress costs the US hundreds of billions of dollars in lost productivity. We will provide a consumer app free of cost and rapidly collect customer usage data and preferences. We have a working prototype and need direct user feedback. After a limited beta, we will launch next year.

The clinically-oriented app will serve customers who have great need for reminders and therapeutic tools. We are working closely with psychiatrists from Washington University in St. Louis to design a pilot study. We expect this study to begin in 6 months.

Adam shared his insights on the St. Louis start up environment with me, and introduced me to Ken Harrington at Wash U.’s Skandalaris Center. Ken in turn introduced me to Jim Brasunas (ITEN), and my conversations with both of them turned independently towards Capital Innovators as a leading accelerator, both regionally and nationally, where SPRY Analytics would be a good fit. ","SPRY's software for financial professionals can reduce their clients' taxes during retirement with optimized account withdrawal strategies. ","Millions of Americans are sitting on healthy nest eggs, but that money can come with an unwelcome side effect: sizable tax liabilities. With trillions of dollars invested in tax-deferred asset accounts like IRAs and 401(k)s, many retirees are facing large tax bills when they reach the withdrawal phase of their investment timeline. These looming tax bills have been characterized as a ""time bomb"" for retirees, but SPRY Analytics views it as an opportunity to offer a solution combining professional expertise and knowledge of retirement planning and a proprietary software service that seeks to optimize a strategic withdrawal plan to minimize taxes. 

SPRY Analytics was formed with the idea that software can be designed to lower the costs of professional expertise and time for individuals who will benefit from a tax-optimized withdrawal strategy before and during retirement. The software reduces the cost and simplifies the process for professionals who want to provide the service to clients. Such analyses are already possible when performed by qualified professionals dedicating significant hours to the process, but the costs of such analyses can reduce or eclipse the benefits they uncover. SPRY's software employs proprietary algorithms to deliver straightforward account withdrawal strategies designed to minimize taxes, and requires only a few minutes to input clients' personal and account information.

Functional prototype: http://spry.dev.tuvastaging.com/ and log in as spry, with password of spryadmin ","The value of Capital Innovators' Accelerator Program for SPRY is in the opportunity it offers for mentorship and the benefits of  hearing directly from experts in different subject matters. SPRY has its product and business models mapped out, but it would be a huge lift for the company to have experts point out anticipated roadblocks and give feedback like knowing when to pivot or persevere. In addition, acceptance would offer validation to our concept and should lower our capital costs. ","David Hogarty - Founder. Dave's  roles are product manager, recruiter, and CEO, in that order. His role as product manager includes customer development, product definition, and development. As a recruiter, he is identifying and filling the crucial gaps in his team's skill sets. And as a CEO he is overseeing the evolution of SPRY's business model and is the point man for keeping the company funded.

When NBC Universal spun up its Local Integrated Media division from the ground up, Dave was hired to help impart a start-up editorial tone and ethos.

Although Scott is a St. Louis local and committed to working with SPRY Analytics, we do not feel that his full time participation will be assured (or required) for the duration of the accelerator program. ","The physical location of SPRY will be determined by the best interests of the company, including access to capital and advisors and proximity to early customers.  ","What makes SPRY Analytics unique is its singular focus on finding the simplest solution to a very complex problem. The challenge of finding an optimal withdrawal strategy is not unknown to financial advisors. The rule of thumb is inefficiently relied upon because of its speed and simplicity. SPRY software strips away the expenses—time and expertise—that limit the application of individualized withdrawal strategies, and offers them to a much broader market than previously possible. ","Most financial advisors and accountants use software to help manage client accounts that include features that take into account the effect of taxes on individual investment plans. What sets SPRY's software apart is its ability to run an optimization algorithm on a client's current financial scenario that recommends a strategic withdrawal path to minimize taxes over an entire investment horizon.   
Space constraints here limit our ability to list competitors and URLs. Please contact for info. ","SPRY has a Software as a Service (SaaS) business model, in which we will sell subscriptions for our software to financial professionals, like financial advisors and tax accountants. Subscriptions will scale along a single axis at first, based on the number of users in customer’s office, followed by the development of premium features that we can offer as an upsell to existing customers, increasing their lifetime value as customers and offsetting churn. ","Because of the size of our addressable and target markets, SPRY Analytics is going to focus on inbound marketing in an effort to align our customer acquisition costs within the market.

Additionally, they will be able to see the likelihood a certain judge will approve or deny their motions, the average cost and average revenue for similar cases (think an ROI for each case) - all in an effort to help them craft litigation strategies and drive higher verdicts and settlements, which means more profits. ","www.litigo.co, username: ben@litigo.co password: Litigo11 ","We want the ability to work full-time and invest 100% of our effort and time into Litigo - going through an accelerator would allow us to pay ourselves and focus on building a great company. Additionally, we would love to collaborate with other companies in the class to see what similar challenges they have faced and how they solved them as well as refine the business strategy through conversations with mentors.  ","Ben Smalley - CEO, Sales, Marketing: Guides product decisions and even helps with building the product (somewhat) and has been hustling to talk with customers, maintains a monthly reading list to gain exposure and business strategy.

Rav Johal - CTO, Rav has worked at Workday for the past 6 years and is a Ruby on Rails developer. He is responsible for managing any contractors we may have and guides technology decisions from code base to server selection and database schema ","2 founders ","Though not on their own startups, both have worked at startups and experienced the culture and pace.

Ben - I was number 200 at Practice Fusion and was on the finance team that raised a Series D of $85M, I have helped with planning and budgeting and the company has grown to 350 employees 

Rav - though Workday isn't a ""startup"" today I too was employee 200 (Workday now has ~2,600) and I have seen it go from a scrappy startup to a full-fledged public company. ","6-12 months ","We will both be committed to working full-time for three months in St. Louis. ","0 employees ","Yes - we can all attend "," ","San Francisco ","Our data visualization / analytics and our focus on firm metrics. Only 10% of lawfirms have a plan for big data or spend money on analytics which shows how unique that is in the legal world to begin with. Moreover, no one else is allowing attorneys to value / research similar cases with such ease. We also give firms the ability to bench mark against other firms and see how their revenues, utilization and billing compares with other similar firms. Very few companies are focusing on the firm. ","Competitors: Clio: goclio.com, Lexis: http://bit.ly/1mDs9Hq, Ravel: www.ravellaw.com), Lexicata: https://lexicata.com, Everlaw: everlaw.com, & Lex Machina: lexmachina.com
What differentiates us is price, ease of use, and the type of law we are focusing on. Being free is a huge advantage BUT you can't compete on price alone. So we are cheap BUT we also have a kickass product for visually researching cases. This is (for now) only helpful to Personal Injury lawyers which no one else is  focusing on ","Initially by selling monthly subscriptions to our research/analytics tool. We will then offer additional data like judge analytics and firm bench marking for additional fees.

Mid term when we have scale we can host banners in the app targeted towards attorneys (I have seen this work well at Practice Fusion) and longer term we can move into the DIY for consumers in the personal injury space and send leads to lawyers and charge them a fee for bringing them clients. ","We plan to leverage Ben's/Ben's father's network of attorneys in Ohio (where he is from) initially. This will be slow and does not scale but will provide us with deep feedback and honest feedback and lasting customers. We have started this process and plan to roll out or beta in the next week or two. After we find product/market fit through this channel we will turn to other marketing like tradeshows, online advertising and strategic partnerships ","Alpha release ","We have a working Alpha version of the product that we have showed to a few users and gotten positive initial feedback. We are continuing to hammer out bug fixes and add a few more features before we feel we are ready to publicly release an MVP beta. ","In the next week or two we plan to public release our Beta and send an announcement to ~1200 attorneys in Ohio. The goal of this next milestone will be to get to product/market fit and really dial-in the analytics to what users want to see and what features are missing. The next jump to full fledge product and charging users will be the most difficult but we are dedicated to making Litigo a success and are open to pivoting if needed. Ben has grown up in and around the law and has a good sense and familiarity with it that if we do need to make a fundamental change to the product we feel confident that we know the industry well enough that we can do that. ","2014-02-01  ","Yes, Deleware C-Corp (Litigo, Inc.) ","8000 ","None ","None ","None ","Yes. Seed money ASAP and a series A soon after. I (Ben) plan to use the seed money to speed up our MVP build and get to product/market fit ASAP. From there I anticipate using out week of week growth and early revenue traction to raise a series A. I would like the seed money to be $150-200k. The Series A will depend on traction as I would look to take on only as much as was needed to build significant value for a Series B round but something around $1M or $1.5M ","Like any startup being discovered is the hardest. Just because we have spent 6 months working on an MVP doesn't mean people will be breaking down our door to use it. We need to find people in our space and often times convince them to do things differently. This is out greatest challenge because without customers we are nothing. The next challenge that goes hand in hand with finding customers is what to charge them. There aren't great comparable out there right now because we are doing something so different. Though this is a big question mark it will be answered on our way to product/market fit so its an unknown but we are not as concerned as customers will tell us what they would pay based on how well we meet their need.

","Nanaya offers a romantic options forecasting and decision analysis to consumers, not matchmaking: Nanaya forecasts love, it doesn't find it. There is no one else that provides objective affirmation of romantic decisions. We are the bookends of online dating, a $4B industry, we help people find love and then affirm it when it's found.

While in the past there have been attempts to predict the chances of finding love, we offer the first general solution to the problem. Moreover, we extend this solution to provide deeper answers to the questions of love: Where should you move to find love? Should you stay with your significant other or find someone else? When is the best time to settle down? Nanaya answers these questions and more powered by an algorithm developed through experience in cost and risk analysis for NASA space missions. 

The user data required for the algorithm is far deeper than what is obtained by Facebook, IAC, and eHarmony. We don't just get personality or consumer preferences but ask hard questions about life history, life goals, and desires surround a major life and consumer decision. Unlike anyone else, we will have desire and history data that cannot be determined via extrapolation from other analytics metrics. This data is of high value to many industries as we can predict market shifts in banking, real estate, pharmaceutical, government, and more. 

By offering a free service, we are poised to obtain this high value data, frequently, at low cost. ","www.nanaya.co

Personality testing will be ready during the holiday season. Beta will be ready by February 2015. Final product will be ready by Q3 2015. ","First and foremost, sponsorship. I am currently self-funding and fully committed. 

Second, exposure. My product generates value through the number of end-users who use it. The mentorship and networking through Capital Innovators will help me broaden my horizons in how I market and establish the product, especially for data analytics.

Finally, mentorship. Though I am experienced in government/defense work its very risk adverse nature, business is new. I need support adapting to the new culture. ","Rashied Amini - Founder, CEO, Theorist ","1 founder ","If there were an corollary to startups in NASA, it would be novel proposal work. In such a case, yes. With only a BS in physics, I have applied and won many grants to study technologies and science investigations by self-education, building a team of experts, and leading them through successful studies.

I have also been a systems engineer for space missions (interplanetary internet demonstrations, total $3M efforts), developing schedules, testing, planning, and management.All missions succeeded ","  ","My PhD can be put on hold but there are some long-term NASA obligations I may continue to support that are sensitive, related to national security. This would be <8hrs/week. I normally work 70+ hour weeks anyway for fun so this is in the noise. I have retired my obligations in study management in these sensitive efforts. ","4+ employees ","Yes - we can all attend "," ","St Louis, MO. ","There are no other services that provide end-user romantic decision analysis, though family, friends, and therapists can be considered competitors. In the B2C market, we are simply peerless and have the enabling technology provisionally protected. Our B2C service will be on a ""freemium"" model.

The data we obtain from users is novel as will be explained below. Based on our database, we can generate strategic demographic reports of user desires relevant to many markets. ","Online matchmaking does determine user romantic personalities and Facebook aggregates ""like"" data used in marketing. The data we require for the algorithm is very deep and unique: user life plans. Specifically, romantic history, life history, current social circles and behavior, desires for settling down and children, desires for specific professions and places to live, etc. 

Our competitors, Facebook, Google, and IAC, can extrapolate some of these desire - we will have definitive answers. ","B2C: The freemium model will draw users in for free results with some for-pay reports answering major romantic and social questions (e.g. ""Should I dump my boyfriend?"" or ""Where should I move?""). 

B2B: We have many different avenues for revenue.
-Selling data for analytics. We can sell (non)-personal data by developing new DB queries. Societal trends in desire can be rapidly developed.
-Licensing to IAC or eHarmony. Our backend can be readily accessed via an API that we can license.
-Therapists ","We plan on following the OkCupid model due to its success. 

We will offer free personality testing separate of the main product. We will generate content through a sociology blog similar to 
OkCupid's. We will offer a free service. The content and free service will attract customers with a low CAC. Initially, we plan on a media campaign, addressing relevant markets in conferences and conventions, and mass marketing though these should eventually give way to word-of-mouth like OkCupid. ","Functional prototype ","By the end of December, we should have some metrics on cost of customer acquisition for end users/B2C based on the number of people utilizing personality testing and signing up for the beta program for mid-2015. We are fastidiously tracking web analytics to understand the social media response to our engagement. We will track these through all stages. ","We have several upcoming milestones. The soonest is opening of personality testing in late November 2014 for which we are on-track. Opening of invite-only Beta testing around Valentine’s Day is the next. After which we will continue to refine our product through Beta feedback until it is ready for a complete launch.

The founder is a NASA systems engineer and has flight project experience. He has developed a development schedule in the spirit of space flight projects. Unknown complexity and issues have been margined for. Failure is not an option. ","2014-09-024 ","We will incorporate January 2015 as a Delaware LLC. ","$13k ","$8-10k/month  ","0 ","0 ","Yes. We will need to raise about $70k before August 2015. ","The below are unique strategic high-level risks to Nanaya. There are other tactical issues, but these must be acknowledged as deal-breakers. We have developed mitigation strategies accordingly.

1.	Challenge: This is a new market and we are unable to assess actual market demand or future CAC.

Mitigation: Obviously there is significant risk to acknowledge in our ignorance. First and foremost, we will market ourselves as adjacent to the already successful online dating market as a complimentary service. We will use familiarity and use of online dating as a vector for advertising and branding.

OkCupid was stunningly successful till its buyout by IAC.  Thus, we will follow the rise of OkCupid as a template where appropriate. We will provide personality testing in the manner OkCupid did during their Spark period. We will generate content in the form of our blog which will do sociology studies of our dataset. We will offer a freemium service (their A-List premium service was instituted under IAC control). All of these will drive CAC low. We seek to achieve <$1.00 CAC in the long-run. Initially, we expect higher cost to build brand familiarity, $2-4/customer.

2.	Challenge: User unwillingness to complete the assessment. Because it takes 15-30m to fill out the survey, users may be unwilling to sit down and take the time for results. 

Mitigation: A contractor who designs UX for the elderly is designing the interface in a user-friendly manner to make input effortless. Moreover, a partnership with Traity ensures that the most tedious portion, scientific personality testing, is enjoyable, fast, accurate, and even potentially viral.

The Beta test program will work to clean the product to the most user-friendly state iteratively converging on a final UI/UX.

3.	Challenge: Finding B2B customers. While we know there is tremendous value in the novel data we will obtain, we are not connected with potential customers to determine the value or structure of the product.

Mitigation: Networking and applying to Capital Innovators. Working with future investors to obtain customers.

4.	Challenge: Traitify licensing. While we stand to have a low CAC, we will pay <$0.50 for every personality test. This is a long-term risk to our revenue stream.

Mitigation: Traitify is transitioning from its previous structure of developing tests for professionals to a web API. We are their first major customer and will work to tailor the product to our needs. This does not mitigate cost but creates the groundwork for a strategic collaboration where we share complimentary goals in the market.

","The complexity of construction projects requires changes to schedules and planning to happen daily. Miscommunication leads to waiting and delays which results in additional costs to the project owner, the contractor, and all the subs involved. Commonly attributed to poor project communication, cost overrun in US construction results in $55 billion annually. We are reducing mistakes and wasted time with clear, open jobsite communication through a mobile and web application.

Most recent efforts to introduce technology into construction have been focused on solutions for the office. Our product is focused on getting information to and from the field, where it is most critically needed. As a consequence, we are targeting one of the biggest and untapped market segments in the construction industry, the subcontractors. Currently, subcontractors do not have a unified platform to store and share scheduling information with other teams across multiple projects.

Jobsite Unite provides project and industry wide access to critical information and resources needed in everyday construction operations. The ability to communicate with any member of a project or team will vastly reduce wasted time, materials, and labor. Project managers, superintendents and foremen will spend less time communicating schedules, changes, reassigning locations, and relocating equipment and manpower while enabling employees with the vital information they need for day to day operations.

(2) Connect and grow relationships with key partners and mentors that have experience, knowledge, and insight into our market who will help grow our business during and after the program.

Steve Adamson ","4+ employees ","Yes - we can all attend ","The team members who are unable to attend have family commitments that don't enable them to relocate for 3 months. These members will be managing the support of our Iowa clients while continuing to gain traction locally at our home office.  ","Des Moines, IA ","Jobsite Unite is unique because we are the only company providing a solution that mimics how the construction industry communicates today. We take the informal, scattered information that is organically created on construction sites and provide a central location for it to be stored and shared. We then provide tools that organize and display this data in a convenient and functional way. We will have reached our goal when there is no skilled construction worker left without work. ","There are several companies addressing the communication and efficiency struggles in construction. At Jobsite Unite we are taking a drastically different approach. Www.fieldlens.com, www.fieldwire.net, and www.plangrid.com currently seem to have the most traction. Their solutions all require a significant shift in jobsite workflow and work habits, while Jobsite Unite compliments how construction sites organically function. This results in a much smaller learning curve and wider user adoption. ","Jobsite Unite is a B2B SaaS company that sells monthly subscriptions. Our customers are mid-large size construction companies that need a better way to communicate with their employees or with subs on their jobsites. The platform also offers a Linkedin-like network which allows individuals to create a free profile and connect with others in their market. ","We are utilizing (2) different avenues for finding and signing up customers. (1) The top down approach: By marketing directly to general contractors, we can contractually obligate everyone on a jobsite to sign up for and use our product. (2) The bottom up approach: By marketing to and signing up individuals to our network, we generate soft leads to the companies they work for which we can then pursue.  ","Public beta release ","We have just launched our product in both the App Store and the Google Play Store. We have three companies that have agreed to use the product on their jobsites. They will begin using the product this week. For the last 2 months we have been testing the apps and product with a subcontracting company of 60. We are currently tracking metrics on engagement, and time saved through reduced interactions ","-Successfully implement on 5 job site groups in the first 2 months of launch. 1/20

We are finishing out our seed round and anticipate raising a series A after 6-8 months of product traction. The timing works out really well with Capital Innovations demo day.  ","Fundraising: We have about a 3 month window from when we run out of our current funds until we are anticipating revenue. We need to raise some more operating funds to support sales, support, and marketing efforts. We initially planned to raise an entire seed round of $450,000 pre-product and pre-revenue. We were able to successfully raise $80,000 in private and $50,000 in the form of a loan from Iowa. We stopped raising and focused on building. Now the product is done, and we need to raise more money to give us a sales and implementation runway.

Sales/Marketing/Operations: Our current sales, implementation, and marketing strategy is very high touch and costly. Currently we have established a very successful plan for gaining traction locally, and establishing product validation. Moving forward, we are going to be tasked with the challenge of scaling our high touch sales, implementation, and support on an international level. Our plan is to convert from this high touch model to a more scalable market share model that is focused on online advertising and inbound customer support.

To sum things up, our biggest obstacle is getting everyone on the teams 100% focus. We have done a great job building a rockstar team who really believes in what we are trying to do. Now we need to secure the resources that would enable all the team members to work on what they are passionate about 100% of their time.

","We offer a way for businesses to manage their business: from social media to mobility; from web presence to viral marketing; from customer collaboration to building customer relationships. We are focused on providing the tools and integrations necessary for their business on one platform. ","Choosing CrossFit as our first niche market, ZenPlanner, Mind Body, and Wodify are the three main competitors. ZenPlanner and Mind Body are not specific to the niche market of CrossFit and offer many features, with a cost, which CrossFit gyms do not need. Wodify offers a mobile gym management system, but that is it. We are going to rock the Crossfit ""Niche"" world and stir up other industries while we're at it (within our base toolset). ","Grind Nation charges a monthly fee for gym owners and companies, including two packages. The ""Lite"" package is at minimal cost to attract owners, and the ""Marbles"" package gives them the full system. With low overhead and offering our services via the cloud their is opportunity for high profit.  There are also plans for a lead-in mobile app that allows easy collaboration, notifications and event management for users. ","The distribution channel will consist of 75% pull strategy and 25% push strategy. Methods used for the pull strategy include, but are not limited to, advertising and mass media promotion, word of mouth referrals, customer relationship management, and sales promotions. For the push strategy, Grind Nation will bring the product to the customers by means of B2B through trade show promotions and direct face-to-face selling to gyms. As the company grows the weight on push strategy will increase. ","Functional prototype ","Our non-revenue transaction is trade for service, valued at approximately $225 worth of services offered by our first customer, St. Peter's CrossFit. Metrics tracked are releases of enhancements to production, minimal defects, and time to deploy fixes.  ","Beta is our next milestone. This step includes a Customer Relationship Manager, overhaul of our current authentication, introduction of extended social media capabilities and full mobility. This full featured enhancement and change of our architecture will only allow parts of the prototype to be ported; meaning that it is a large task or re-write.

","iDoFund is a crowd-funding web app where the brides, grooms and their guests can raise money for their wedding without being assessed credit card fees.  Additionally, key vendor partners and a fixed pricing model gives iDoFund an competitive advantage over other solutions. Vendor partners pay for credit card processing and no other fees.  There is a minimal crowd funding layout with video, ""pay what you want"" gift button, stretch goals, and bride and groom blog updates.  It will be the ""flexible"" campaign type where you can keep whatever is funded to you.  iDoFund uses the stretch goals concept with one vendor per stretch goal.  In this way, only one vendor is being funded at a time. When Vendor A is fully funded, then Vendor B is funded and so-on.  This allows the Bride and Grooms to prioritize their vendors, and only one vendor will be partially funded at any point in time.  Money is collected by iDoFund and paid directly to the vendors via bank transfer (via Stripe).  With this money-flow, it makes the monetary gifts more meaningful. The Bride and Groom will receive a paper gift-certificate to use with the Vendor for their wedding.  Additionally, this money-flow commits the brides to the vendor partners and allows partners to offer promotional pricing and offers.    Instead of large, uncapped percentage fees and credit card fees that are accessed by our competitors, iDoFund charges $39 per vendor out of funds raised. ","No demo or website is live at the moment.  The URL is http;//ido.fund ","Through Capital Innovators, I hope to gain Klout and press behind my vision which will give me access to key partnership opportunities and a broader client-base.

","MeterGenius is a free website and mobile app that provides tools and incentives for homeowners to engage with and lower their electricity usage. MeterGenius gives homeowners with smart meters the ability to track electricity consumption at a granular level, create reminders to help them change their behavior, control their smart thermostat, set goals and track their progress, compare themselves to similar neighbors, and earn points that can be redeemed for bill credits.

Our focus on user engagement not only sets us apart from competitors, but has allowed us to deliver superior results - increasing retention by 27%! The 3 pillars of our user engagement strategy work together to strengthen the impact of each other. First, we create user-specific suggestions to help our users become more energy efficient. These suggestions come from our analysis of their smart meter data, as well as their responses to profile questions about their home, consumption habits, and motivations. Our second pillar is the tools that allow our users to act upon the suggestions we make. For example, we currently integrate with Emerson's Sensi, so our users can control their thermostat from our app, or sign up for programs that allow MeterGenius to control their thermostat more efficiently. Finally, the thing that ties all of this together is our rewards program. We provide points for reducing electricity and using energy during low cost times. These points can be redeemed for energy efficient appliances. ","https://metergenius.com/

The other co-founders are not working full time on MeterGenius. ","St. Louis, MO ","Unlike competitors, MeterGenius is focused on engaging electricity customers in order to increase retention and reduce energy usage.  Our biggest differentiator is our rewards program, which motivates users to lower their energy usage and use electricity when costs are lowest for electricity suppliers.  Every electricity provider faces variable costs per kWh throughout the day, but no program exists that rewards users for using electricity more during off-peak hours and less during peak hours. ","There are multiple energy analytics companies, such as Opower (http://opower.com), Tendril (http://www.tendrilinc.com), MyEnergy(https://www.myenergy.com), and LowFoot (http://www.lowfoot.com), however they’re all designed to lower electricity bills by 2-3% by simply comparing users to their neighbors.  MeterGenius is the only solution for competitive electricity suppliers that is designed to increase customer retention by increasing engagement.  None of these companies have a rewards program. ","MeterGenius generates revenue by licensing our software to retail electricity suppliers on a price per customer basis.  We have a flat fee for all customers and additional fees for customers that create an account or opt into our smart thermostat program.  Our second source of revenue comes from selling smart appliances to our users.  These appliances are integrated with the MeterGenius app and are usually purchased by the electricity suppliers and then given to their customers for free.  ","We sell to marketing decision makers of retail electricity providers. Most of our conversations have resulted from our large network of energy industry veterans. Some potential clients have even reached out to us, as they have heard about MeterGenius through various press hits. We intend to position MeterGenius as an expert in customer engagement by presenting at various industry forums. Our CEO has been invited to speak at industry events, including ComEd's Smart Grid Exchange Forum in Chicago. ","Non-revenue customer traction ","ComEd, the utility that serves over 4 million households in norther Illinois, agreed to a six month paid pilot with 6,400 customers.  This pilot has not launched yet, but it will launch at the beginning of the year.  We're also in talks with MC Squared, a competitive electricity supplier in Illinois, to use MeterGenius in a community with 70,000 households. ","Our next milestone will be our first revenue, and we expect to reach this milestone in Q1 2015.  We already have a commitment from ComEd for a pilot program worth $32,000.  How ever, we hope to land a much larger deal with MC Squared.  This deal could generate over $3.5 million in revenue in the first year of the contract.  If we do secure the MC Squared contract, the program will not start until May 2015, but some initial revenue should come in before then. ","2013-01-10 ","Yes, MeterGenius is a C-Corp ","$135,000 ","$8,000 ","$0 ","$0 ","Our fundraising plans are based on whether or not we win a large contract in the next 3 months. If we win a large contract, worth over $250,000, we'll raise a larger round ($1-3 million) in order to build out our team and further develop the product. If we do not win a large contract, our only revenue will be the $32k from the ComEd pilot, so we'll need to raise about $200,000 to improve our product and win that first big contract. We hope to secure funding by April 2015.

","Competitors: Twitter, Facebook, Mass Text Messaging Services, Local Newspapers, Local Newsletters, Groupon

Twitter and Facebook are great, but unless students are following your business or liking your business page, you bet they will never hear about your business, even if you are .2 miles down the road from their campus.
 ","What we realized about our product and platform is that every time we launch at a new campus, we will be adding revenue automatically. We calculated that at minimum, 35% of the total businesses in a 20 mile radius of a university/college campus will use our platform. In the future, every time we launch at a new school and depending on the size of the campus we are launching at, we could add at minimum $50K yearly revenue for a small college, and $150K yearly for a large college. ","We have received interest from thousands of students across 300+ schools because we are solving a need and because they have shown interest in our product. Other ideas we have for the future that will attract more college and local business users & increase our revenue (connected to revenue question above): Integrate ticketing for events into our platform. Connecting with a large textbook company like Chegg and having textbook purchases directly from our app to make it easy for students. ","Non-revenue customer traction ","We have had over 2,000 students in 300 schools nationwide ask us for our product at their campus. Also, 75% of businesses that we have visited and pitched our product to, have shown interest and want to become a part of it.

Tiesport is the answer to this.

To make it possible, we do gather data from people’s background (Linkedin/Facebook) and then we start diagnosing their current contacts network. We provide them feedback on how to improve it and start suggesting activities with other professionals based on their preferences.

By collecting this information we are in a position to provide trust grades between users through a machine-learning algorithm.

www.giftsomethin.com/demo/GiftCardIntegration.jpg

The gifting requirement is pretty dynamic.
The consumer can sometimes afford the gift, sometimes he can't.
She/he sometimes wants to create a group gift, sometimes he doesn't.
Sometimes she/he wants to gift money, sometimes not.

For these situations, the consumers are swarmed with apps/sites that provides these features, individually. 
You cant expect the customer to use one app/site for wedding registry, one for baby registry, one for gift card, one for creating a group gift and so on. This type of requirement requires a SOLUTION to the consumer rather than apps/sites for individual features. 
Regardless of what the requirement/situation the customer is in, he should have a go-to app/site for it; instead of having to go through multiple apps/sites.

giftSomethin' is the SOLUTION to this requirement.

giftSomethin' will provide ease of access - everything gift related will be available within this app.

The consumer will not have to download multiple app for various operations like gifting, giftcards, group gifting etc.

She/he also does not have to have a different app or go to a different site to create a wedding registry, baby registry etc.

giftSomethin' is a go-to app for everything gift related.

","Statistics shows that on an average, one life is lost every two hours and an economic loss of approximately $30MM is incurred due to distracted driving. At least 26% of all crashes involved drivers either texting or talking on their mobile phones while driving. Our goal is to develop an affordable solution for distraction-free driving, while not hindering the benefits of the mobile phone.

From the outset, we found a new application for existing technology with relatively minor modifications. This strategy enables us in faster product cycle resulting in quicker entry into the markets, a key advantage for the entrepreneur and investors.  

We successfully developed a prototype utilizing readily available hardware that is currently used for different applications in different sectors. By appropriately modifying, we were able to tailor the hardware to reuse for this specific application. The complete solution includes an RF transmitter that communicates with our app on the phone. The solution differentiates between the driver and the passenger resulting in the ability to engage the driver's mobile phone only. The end-users will have the opportunity to disable (texting, calling) and enable (maps, emergency calls) various functions . It provides the ability to reconfigure the non-safe (driver's seat) and safe areas within the car. The total cost of the product to the company is less than $26. We are currently working on reducing this price to less than $12. "," ","Our current status includes a developed prototype with intellectual property (provisional) in place. We anticipate entering the market in mid 2015 with our first product - a standalone system. We anticipate launching a second product in early 2016, with more functionality that can generate individual driving profiles. Simultaneously, we would like to start hardware development. To achieve these milestones, we need guidance in terms of strategy development, hiring staff and raising capital. ","Dr. Shashaanka Ashili, CEO/CTO.

Both their products  costs more than $100 and suffer from poor zoning (safe and non-safe) capabilities within the car.
Our product costs less than $26 to the company. It leaves room for healthy margin while keeping the costs down to the end users. ","The first generation product is standalone with limited configurability. Our initial focus will be on families with teenage children. We intend to expand the market to include fleet services and corporate vehicles. A second generation of this product shall generate analytics from the data collected, providing guidance to drivers on improving their driving habits, while also providing an opportunity to service providers such as Insurance companies and Fleet managers to estimate the risk profiles. ","Our primary route to find customers will be digital marketing. The digital campaign includes working with non-profits, maintaining robust social media presence and promoting the product through conferences.

","Maki is a mobile application that allows customers of restaurants to browse the menu, make orders, and view and pay their bill all from their phone.

The app allows two-way syncing with the restaurant POS, making it ""unobtrusive"" (like JS on a web page). In other words, a customer could use Maki to browse the menu to see popular dishes, specials, and past orders, then order through the waiter, then track the order on Maki and pay using Maki when they're done. What amakes it easy is that our application is deployed from the cloud, it doesn't require any technicians or engineers to physically install the program in the restaurant and the POS system can be seamlessly integrated.

The main problems this app solves is wasted time waiting (up to ~20 mins per table turnover) & settling the bill on the customer side It also reduced high labor costs on the restaurant side (which amounts to ~30% of total revenue). As we've shown this product to restaurant owners and customers, our team has received very strong validation (often, we'll get calls several days later with comments like ""I was out eating today and totally would've loved to use your app to {pay | browse | order}"".

By charging a low, flat monthly rate and offering a rich feature set that takes the difficulty out of trying to manage all the different facets of sending and receiving LTL freight and provides shippers everything they need to negotiate directly with carriers, FG is positioned to change the way small to midsize manufacturers send LTL freight.  FG manages all of a user's customer and freight data, and gets smarter the more it is used.  Features: Shipping includes pulling rates from multiple carriers onto one screen, automating and aggregating email rate requests, creating all necessary shipping documents, and sending notices to the carrier and consignee.  The tracking functionality allows users to manage both their inbound and outbound shipments and easily communicate with customers and suppliers.

","Existing social networks such as Twitter or Facebook have clumsy or unstructured methods of gauging instant social opinion. Similar to Vine, our free mobile polling application integrates with these applications and allows users to create and share micro polls across their entire social networks instantly.  Our application provides an immersive experience that has seen strong user growth considering we have not launched a formal marketing program.

While there are competing live polling tools in the enterprise and social spaces, we are differentiating ourselves by improving how brands interact with and learn about their customer base.  Because approximately 90% of our users register for our application using their Twitter or Facebook credentials, we can leverage a user's demographic data and cross reference it with their responses to Cast poll questions to provide meaningful data and instant market research to brands desiring a better return on their digital marketing efforts.

How can we effectively grow and retain our user base?  By aligning with key social media content producers with significant, loyal networks and by allowing brands to offer rewards for answering micro polls within the app. Brands can offer discounts, special promotions, or giveaways to users who answer micro polls.  Users can accumulate rewards from their favorite brands simply by answering questions.   

We will be in the business of accumulating, refining, and selling marketing intelligence to brands. ","http://castapp.co

Our live polling app is available for download in the Apple store under ""Cast"". ","While we believe we have a strong team, product, and vision, we know there is always more we can learn from mentors and industry leaders who know the spaces in which we plan to thrive.  We are seeking structure, validation, accountability, mentoring, input on product refinement, and exposure to investors outside our existing networks.  We are eager to learn and use the tools available in the program to grow into a sustainable business. ","Matt Sebek (CEO) - leader and face of the franchise
Ruben Quintero (CTO) - coordinates the product vision and execution
Joe Pimmel (CFO/COO) - overall strategy, finance, and operations
Ben Grove (Chief Creative Officer) - leads our design and front-end development ","4 founders ","Our team has strong experience working in/on startups:
1) Matt, our CEO, is the founder of both RookiesApp as well as JoeSportsFan.  He has a strong social media presence in the sports world. 
2) Ruben, our CTO, is currently working full time for Cast.  
3) Joe, our CFO, is also the CFO of BusyEvent and Living Like A Lady, both startups located here in St. Louis.  Joe also serves as a Lead Fellow for the Billiken Angel Network and has provided mentoring/consulting to several startup companies. ","1-2 years ","Our CTO (Ruben) is already working full-time in the business and, if accepted to the program, our CEO (Matt) would also commit to transitioning to a full-time role in the business. Due to the stage of our company, it is not necessary for Joe (CFO) or Ben (Chief Creative Officer) to be working full-time in the business, although both would be fully committed to the program itself. ","0 employees ","Yes - we can all attend ","n/a ","We plan to remain located here in St. Louis as we are all based here. ","First, we provide a mobile live polling app for free users and brands that can API with Twitter and Facebook.  Currently, live polling options for Twitter and Facebook are noisy, unstructured, and not able to be archived. Second, because we gain access to demographic data for over 90% of our users when they register with Facebook and Twitter, we will be able to combine results of micro polls created by brands with key demographic information to provide a mobile channel for market intelligence.  ","Cast was created after seeing brands/individuals leverage social tools such as Twitter and Facebook to poll their audiences. The problem is that these platforms were not created specifically for questions & answers. Cast is a dedicated experience that integrates with existing social circles.

In the past year, several similar apps have been released including ThreeCents, Voice, and Thumb. However, these apps do not have a brand/reward focus, which is where our core revenue model is built around. ","Our target customers will be any brands with a strong social media presence and an innovative interest in new ways of learning about and growing their customer base. At this stage, we envision making money in three ways:

1) Fees from brands who offer rewards to users for answering polls.
2) Fees from brands who purchase raw data streams from the company related to their polls.
3) Fees from brands who desire more formal, structured reports with interpretive results related to their polls. ","For sports teams in the digital world, we are finding that if you can get one team to show positive results from a new feature or product, they will often refer it to the league-wide offices for potential greater distribution.  We have been working on pilot programs with the St. Louis Blues and the St. Louis Rams as a result.

For non-sports brands, we will reach chief marketing officers and digital marketing teams using social media advertising and strategic marketing targeted to those groups. ","Public beta release ","We are pre-revenue and are seeking pilot partners currently.  However, our app is available in the iOS store and we have seen nice growth in free users based solely on word of mouth.  In addition, we reached a contract with Darren Rovell, a national ESPN sportswriter, to join our advisory board and use Cast as his sole live polling tool on Twitter to grow our free user base nationally. ","Our milestones for the next 6-9 months are primarily product-focused until we have completed several pilot programs to gauge effectiveness of the platform and to grow the existing free user base.  Following are the core milestones of that plan:

1) Improvements to the existing iOS/web app (anonymous voting/""nearby"" technology/embeddable polls)
2) Integration with existing applications for two current pilot partners
3) Development of minimum viable reporting dashboard for brands (customers) to analyze trends and analysis
4) Development of minimum viable user profiles and rewards platform
5) Development of back end data analysis reporting structure for distribution to customers.
6) Acquisition and execution of pilot programs with 3-5 partners to test and refine #3, #4, and #5 above.
7) Significantly grow existing free user base via content and grassroots marketing efforts.
8) Continued development of Android application. ","2013-09-01 ","We are incorporated as an LLC.

","We've built a shopping tool that enables furniture retail customers to walk away with a virtual collection of the products they view in-store or online. These customers typically do not buy in-store or online their first visit as these larger, more considered purchases usually require thought, feedback from friends/family/designers/experts, and price comparison. Customers can create ""collections"" (similar to wish lists) from a retailer's online or physical store and share them with their group of friends and family, where all of the participants can then make comments and add products to that ""collection"" from any other online retailer. It's a fun and easy multi-channel shopping experience for retail customers. It increases conversion to sales from customers that usually leave without buying on an online or store visit their first time, increases order size, and gives retailers insight into potential future purchases that leads to a larger lifetime value of a customer.

The retailer is able to participate in the shopping journey and can then appropriately insert themselves in that conversation through recommendations, or offering various perks such as discounts or access to an expert designer. The experience is fun and easy for the customers and the benefits to the retailer include increased conversion and order size, more email addresses in the CRM, reduced cart abandonment, and competitive insight.

","0 employees ","Yes - we can all attend ","Tito has 4 children and probably could not attend the program for the entire time. He currently has a full-time job but is ready and excited to work on Chatalog full-time as soon possible (read: as soon as we raise enough money to pay him a full-time salary to support the kiddos).  ","Columbus, OH ","Within the last 6 months we've really narrowed down and focused on changing the home furnishings industry. The industry itself is notoriously archaic with very few retail brands even attempting to try and make themselves technologically adept. Our tool finally lets customers create an easy omni-channel experience that provides insight into the shopping experience that retailers never had before. ","You could probably bucket us in with Amazon Wish List or Pinterest's Private boards but those are all consumer facing products, neither of those provide retailers with valuable insight or data on what their customer's are doing. By targeting brands directly, we give them increased conversions and order size, we reduce cart abandonment, give them competitive insight and data, and give them more email addresses in the CRM. ","We sell to retailers. We charge them an upfront fee for custom brand work, and then either a monthly fee or percentage of sales. As we continue to gather competitive data, we will look to sell that information as well. ","We've acquired all of our customers through cold-calling or word-of-mouth. Columbus, OH has been a great market for us to be able to meet a handful of furniture retailers face to face. We've also partnered with CloudTags (cloudtags.com) as their online solution and have worked together to sign clients. ","Revenue ","We have just signed our first 2 clients and are working to get live on their site. At this point, we are looking for solid data, so we are only asking our initial client beta testers to cover our internal costs to get up and going, and a small monthly fee for the beta test (3-6 months).  ","Our next milestone is to be live on a retailer's site to start proving some of our hypotheses. We've signed a couple clients so we expect to be live before the end of 2014. We believe we need a 3-6 month data set to start proving out some of our theories, so we expect by summer of 2015 to have a solid data set of at least 5-10 different furniture retailers that we can then in turn use to scale accordingly.

","For a long time we felt that we continuously had to tweak and make changes to our product before we could offer it confidently to retailers. We finally feel our product is in a solid place to get live on a retailer's site, but our biggest challenge has been actually getting live once we sign a client. We feel confident that we're now able to get to the right person to sell the concept and tool and get them excited about Chatalog. We're running into challenges that once we've gotten the client signed, how do we quickly and effectively work with their internal IT team (who is used to working at a big corporation) and get them excited about working quickly to get live with a startup.

Users swipe up to connect with other people that appear interesting. If both users want to network, they can instantly chat, connect via LinkedIn, meet, and start building a relationship.
Similarly users can find out about business events, see who’s planning to go, swipe up an event to join, purchase tickets, or start communicating with attendees ordered by relevance and common grounds.  

In order to decide which people and events to display first, our algorithm takes into account business similarities (based on LinkedIn), relevancy (based on user’s filters and search), location, time, and event attendance. The result is a very accurate list of people and events that are the most relevant for the user.

Event organizers can now sync their Eventbrite accounts (we are an official Eventbrite partner), allowing an easy, fully automatic import of their current and future events to be featured on PROsimity.    

Aimed to increase members-engagement, our community/group features allow community-owners to stay in-touch with their members, promote events, make announcements and let members of the same community connect with each other as well as discover other members they’ve never met.

As users of other dating applications, we've grown tired and frustrated with the mundane process of filtering through picture/profiles of people that may or may not look or be like their profile says.

A user simply downloads our app from the App Store and it automatically scans and categorizes all the music on their phone by tempo, so they can always match their feet to the beat while they run. 

How It Works: 

People love TempoRun so much because of its intuitive design. Our app categorizes a user’s music library on their smartphone into different levels, 1-10, based on tempo, similar to a treadmill. When running on a certain tempo level, every song will be close to the same beats per minute (bpm), or tempo. A user can match their running pace to this beat to create a more fluid and exhilarating running experience. Level 1 is a walking pace (slow tempo), level 5 is a jog (medium tempo), and level 10 is a fast sprint (fast tempo). This system is easy for runners to understand and use because it really is like taking a treadmill with you wherever you run. 

We also collect all relevant running stats needed by runners. Every time someone engages in a run, our app will track their distance, pace, and calories burned! ","Website: www.temporunapp.com

Demo: https://vimeo.com/110158899 ","We have many incredible future plans and revenue streams, but want to make sure we implement them in the perfect way. The only way to do this is to seek help and mentorship from others, and Capital Innovators is known to be one of the best mentorship accelerators out there. Our goal after completing Capital Innovators is to release/be close to releasing our 2.0 version. This includes in app purchases in the form of interval workouts and a streaming tempo radio, as well as an in app reward system ","Josh Leider: Founder, CEO

","Our Tempo Level Categorization system is what we are most proud of as a company. This intuitive and simple system lets runners view our app like they would view a treadmill, and this makes it easy to use tempo as a means to enhance ones run. Science has proven that running at 180 beats per minute or higher can significantly improve running form and abilities: http://www.temporunapp.com/science ","Our biggest competitors, Trailmix and Cadence, do provide a similar service as TempoRun, but TempoRun looks to differentiate itself by ease of use, more effectiveness in improving runners abilities, and by fixing the issues users have had with Trailmix and Cadence. TempoRun’s tempo level system will make it competitively more attractive to consumers than it’s competitors.  ","Up until a month ago, we were making money through direct app sales charing $1.99 for the app. We sell to fitness enthusiasts who have smartphones.

•	Sponsoring and being involved with many big running events
•	Integrating extremely well with smart watches

","CitySlooth is a mobile-enabled website that provides an inexpensive way for any business or organization to promote its events, daily specials, coupons, and featured products and services, allowing consumers to see what is happening around them, at any time, for free.  

CitySlooth has two goals: to provide the small business and non-profit an easy, inexpensive online marketing tool for promoting timely content; and to create a highly searchable, geocentric tool for finding out what is happening anytime and anywhere.   CitySlooth alerts subscribers to special opportunities just a few doors away, and also shows them everything that is going on within range of a specific location.  Publishers can update their promotions at any time, and even track conversions in real time.  CitySlooth is completely free to subscribers.

With a flat monthly fee of $50 for businesses, CitySlooth is well below the cost of traditional marketing, such as mailers or print ads, which cost at least several times that for minimal exposure.

Real estate agents will use CitySlooth as a way to build long-term relationships with both residents and businesses in the areas they serve.  We will leverage our national network of real estate schools and companies to find licensees in other markets as we expand across the country. ","http://www.cityslooth.com ","Ultimately, we need seed funding.

We are measuring individual clicks and views to determine the value to our audience, as well as the number of subscribers to determine overall potential. ","We are currently in the pre-revenue stage. Our plan is to generate rich consumer content so that we can build an active consumer base; this will make CitySlooth more attractive as a fee-based marketing program for small businesses.  We plan to have a subscriber base of 500 consumers by the end of 2014, using a combination of social media and word-of-mouth promotions, as well as weekly contests to encourage new subscriptions. At the same time, we are reaching out to businesses and organizations in the St. Louis area to try CitySlooth for free during our launch. We expect to reach early revenue by the end of Q1 2015, with 1000 consumers and 100 active business publishers. We will engage real estate agents in neighborhoods around St. Louis to use CitySlooth as their marketing vehicle.

The Pheeva mobile bitcoin wallet combines a sleek interface with a robust backend to provide world-class user experience, security, and reliability. Its simple design makes sending and receiving bitcoin intuitive for all transactions and balance inquiries. By eliminating the currently steep learning curve associated with bitcoin, Pheeva is poised to become the “go-to” mobile Bitcoin wallet. In addition we are developing block-chain based reward programs and cashless payments systems that use the revolutionary technology behind bitcoin without its risk and volatility. These highly scalable products allow business districts, towns, or even whole cities to implement cost effective and flexible reward programs. These programs offer a 2-3% advantage over credit card fees, custom in-app promotional tools, and detailed consumer analytics, all within your mobile device. The backbone of all of these applications is the blockchain, which allows fast, transparent, transaction of value across a decentralized network at a small fraction of the cost.

Pheeva also has the greatest purchasing power with a partnership with gyft, allowing bitcoin purchases to over 200 retailers who do not accept Bitcoin.   ","Our revenue streams include: 

1) Commission on mobile commerce sales through Pheeva Plus, our in-app marketplace. (Currently, we get 3% on Gyft sales).
2) App Sales- We plan to charge for our premium applications.
3) ""Powered by Pheeva""- Fees for custom-built blockchain applications, such as cashless rewards programs
4) Pheeva Promote- Our in-app digital advertising network 
 ","Our biggest target demographic is college students. Our first college event, the unveiling of the Pheeva Georgia Tech wallet, was extremely successful at gaining new users and growing awareness. We plan to replicate this event with BitPay and continue providing ""Powered by Pheeva"" custom wallets to schools around the world. Our “Troll Please” video campaign targets tech enthusiasts as we continue to maximize the reach of our social media platforms including Twitter, Instagram, Reddit, and FB.  ","Revenue ","We have had recurring revenue with growth over the past 3 months through consumer adoption and an increase in mobile purchases. We currently average around $50 of revenue per active user through digital gift card purchases alone. This is a proof of concept for additional Bitcoin companies to advertise within our wallet in the future.  ","Our next milestone is 100,000 users. The time it takes for us to reach this goal depends on our ability to accomplish two things. First, we need to bring on another developer to assist in the design and development of current and future products. This will reduce bottlenecking in the programming process and enable us to quicken the pace of product development. Secondly, we need to market our product to a much larger audience. This would involve launching our full college outreach tour with BitPay, running YouTube pre-roll video advertisements and promoted/boosted social media posts, and developing additional ""Powered by Pheeva"" branded wallets. We are also in the process of crowdfunding a TV commercial to be played during the NCAA St. Petersburg Bitcoin Bowl, sponsored by BitPay.

Gaming and real-time responsiveness in web and mobile technologies offer new kinds of social interactions to abstract into the online environment.  We can do a better job of using technology to enhance our social interactions, rather than abstracting them.

I am creating a platform to help groups work together more effectively.  Cloud-based apps which teach, enhance, manage and measure interpersonal relationships can use real-time web and mobile technology in novel ways, which bring proven IRL techniques online.  Essentially, my platform would virtualize the leadership training exercises that have tradionally been used by consultants, militaries, teachers and camp counselors.  Initially, my platform would consist of two parts.  First, a team building game that virtualizes a training technique I used as a raft guide to quickly build synergy in a group of 3-7 people.

","Book discovery is difficult to achieve and authors have many choices with various price points to accomplish this monumental task. Their options range from Facebook campaigns, Google AdWords, informal alliances with other authors, LinkedIn Groups, and more expensive options like hiring a publicist and paying for radio and television interviews. No matter what combination of options they employ, the recognized best practice is to gain a following and market through social media.

Bookarma is unique because it allows authors to go beyond the boundaries of their own social circles and reach readers in other circles. Authors on the Bookarma platform share books written by other authors with their followers, and other authors do the same for them. In doing so, all authors expand their reach beyond what they could achieve on their own. They touch a global audience without having to cultivate that audience themselves.

Our belief that Bookarma was unique was validated in May 2014, at BEA in New York and again in October 2014, at the Frankfurt Book Fair. The most common reaction from the top professionals in the industry continues to be, “This is brilliant. I’ve never seen anything like it.” ","http://bookarma.net ","I would like to be mentored through the start-up process and gain funding ","I am the sole founder and am the COE (Chief of Everything).

Bookarma allows authors to break through the barriers of their own social circles and leverage the social media accounts of other authors.  ","I've been told by publishing industry professionals that we have no direct competitors because this is such an original concept. Currently authors market books through social media on their own, or they hire companies (many of them fly-by-night) to help. Here are a few samples:

authormarketingclub.com/ ","This is a subscription-based business and we sell to authors.  ","At first, we sought out individual authors -- the end users.

I am working with self-publishing houses in the US, Germany, and India to reach their authors; with publishing service providers such as BookBaby to reach their authors, and small independent presses.  ","Revenue ","In October 2014, I was a featured speaker on the Publishing Perspectives Stage at the Frankfurt Book Fair in Germany. youtu.be/uQlWWh96AZM. 

In order to be accepted as a speaker, I had to be vetted by their committee as an original thinker who had a unique perspective to deliver to this global audience at the largest publishing convention in the world. ","Now that the basic application is built, the next milestone is to build the publicly visible marketing site to give potential authors the information and incentive to join. Areas addressed will be;

i. Expose more inner working of Bookarma for authors
ii. Promote benefits to authors
iii. Testimonials from authors
iv. Shape up call to action and conversion process
v. A/B testing on conversion and pricing
vi. Utilize blog of authors more upfront and resourceful

","HealthyCow is a biotech for the dairy industry. Our products improve and optomize a cow's metabolism and microbiom to maximize health, immunity, and productivity. The end goal is to extend productive life of a cow & improve dairy producer economics.

ProMunity: Augments the animal's immune system enabling it to fight off infectious agents. It is addressing the fields of managing metabolic disorders and antimicrobials. Ultimately, direct and indirect competition is extensive which covers mineral replacement therapies, antibiotics, and vaccines.

ProPreg: Augments the microbiota of the animal to improve reproductive success. Competition is thinner in the field of fertility since the main products on the market are hormonal synchronization, mineral supplement, antibiotics (to address uterine infections) and services to improve fertility success. There are no direct direct competitors to ProPreg. Furthermore, ProPreg can be used in conjunction with existing therapies, thus complimenting existing products.

HCC has a large vision to develop and implement a ""complete system"" that addresses dairy cow health. Combined with ProPreg and ProMunity, HCC will eventually develop a point-of-care handheld diagnostic tool. This tool will function as a complimentary diagnostic to enable producers to monitor the prognosis and health status of the cow, especially related to the biomarkers HCC products are modulating to optimize cow health.

The first social network connecting online and physical world. ","There are people in the world who want to say something meaningful and important. Sometimes Facebook friends or Twitter Followers are not enough to spread your voice across the world. 

Deehubs is social network where people directly post on public screens (indoor and outdoor billboards). It is new communication channel where users have access to thousands of people walking in the streets. All you need to do is to download Deehubs mobile app. It's like Twitter but connected to Deehubs billboards. So you create content and your messages, videos and pictures appear in streets in real time. 

Deehubs is not only effective solution for people but also for billboards. Today world knows four major screens: Mobile, TV, Computer and Electronic Billboard. Three out of these four are booming because here we have social content + advertisement. Billboards are boring because they are all about ads. Deehubs makes them engaging by bringing social content.

","1 employee ","Yes - we can all attend "," ","New York or Chicago ","Everyone thinks billboard is just for advertisement. Many try to build interactive billboards but all of them first focus on advertisers and only after that on regular users. Thus every activity is just one time marketing campaign and no one ends up with retained user base.

We do everything other way around. We are first socially conscious company in outdoor advertisement industry. So we are building user base around billboards that opens doors to analytics and makes our screens smarter. ","Our biggest competition comes from traditional electronic billboards, which just show 24 hour video commercials. Here major public screen owners are Clearchannel, JCDecaux and CBS Outdoor. Deehubs' billboard advantage is first high engagement because of the rich content and second ad prices on our screens are lower because of our diversified revenue model.  ","We monetize on advertisement and users messages. 

Together with social messages Ads still stay on Deehubs Billboard for 24 hour just appearance is different. Brands will be able to place targeted and keyword commercials, they can reply to each message of users. 

In addition of that Deehubs generated revenue from priced users posts. Messaging on billboard is free but if user wants to choose exact message display time (for example tomorrow at 12 pm) then he needs to pay for it.  ","We are unique startup while our billboards itself stands for our marketing and they are most effective advertising channel for us. 
Deehubs makes location targeting so we will put our screens in major cities, iconic streets, malls, restaurants and etc. After each new screen we will start location-based marketing through social media. 

To bring advertisment on our billboards we will partner with Media Agencies. We already showcased to Leo Burnett, Mediacom, Universal, OMD and Starcom.  ","Public beta release ","1. Technology was tested on largest billboards of Dubai 
2. Showcased to media agencies (leo burnett, mediacom, univesral) and they're committed to have campaigns 
3. Piloting in Impact Hub Seattle and Seattle Startup Week
4. Paid Customer Spitfire: $500 per month 
5. Late stage negotiations with Sony (to use software in Japan) and Saudi Arabia Signs (150 digital signs across the country) ","For following two months we plan to put first two Deehubs billboards and fully launch our product. 

In three year perspective we plan to have 14 billboards, with 15 mln user base and 7mln in gross revenue (45k per billboard).

To achive the goal the company needs to start fundraising but we might be little bit on early stage for VCs or Angel Groups.

But TIMING is particularly important when it comes to travel activities, festivals & events.

At Qalendra, we design algorithms that aggregate information from a variety of sources and identify the best time for each specific activity anywhere in the world.

As an example: by aggregating information about weather, geo-location, boat rentals, fish migration patterns and moon phases we can recommend the best time to go deep sea fishing anywhere in the world.

We use the API layer of the Internet and our proprietary algorithms to identify and recommend the best time to travel for specific activities (like skiing, playing golf, skydiving, attending a festival or a sport event) anywhere in the world.

Also, we recommend accommodation nearby festivals venues, most convenient transportation and other activities to do while in location that match user's profile. ","Top competitors: Gogobot, Wanderfly, TouristEye, travel companies that all got acquired in the last 2 years by Google, TripAdvisor or Lonely Planet.
All of them recommend relevant trips to travelers.
But none of them is a travel calendar.
The time dimension in today's online travel is completely missing. ","Market:
Adventure travelers represent 41.9% of total travelers worldwide. They spend 30% more on a trip than common travelers.
Total adventure travel market is worth $263 billion – excluding airfare – and the average yearly increase in was of 65% from 2009 to 2012.
Addressable market: adventure travelers represent 47% of EU population (246 mil. individuals) and 16% of US population (50 mil.). 

Monetization:
Affiliate sales: hotels (Expedia), flights (Skyscanner), activities (Viator) ","Mobile app distributed via our partner T-Mobile - our mobile app to be pre-installed on T-Mobile smart phones in Romania (test country).

Content marketing - to promote our quality, original content that is very appealing in social media.

We run 2 field tests so far targeting US and UK. Findings:

","We are building a contact focuses system for debt collection.  We are going to cloud host the entire stack.  Web Application, Voice over IP phone system and Voice over IP Dialer systems.  These systems are all tightly integrated into the platform.  Currently nobody in the collection software industry has an entirely cloud based system that has the full stack of services integrated.  The system integrates, Click to call, Click to leave message, MMS messaging, click to fax (planned), click to mail letter (planned), and call recording all under 1 product.  We also plan to bring on predictive dialing later.

We are also going to target our customers differently.  Right now most of the systems have a high upfront cost and high monthly recurring costs.  Being a cloud bases system we are just going to charge the monthly fee.  Our focus is also going to be different.  We are going to focus on smaller companies and helping them set up an internal process for their collections and use our product to streamline their outsourcing.

The last part is we are going to focus our system on security.  We are going to run it off of AWS initially at least and we are going to be HIPPA / HITECH and PCI-DSS Level 1 complaint.  By doing this and controlling the entire stack that would fall within scope we should be able to make compliance for the companies using our service much easier. ","http://demo.strivedct.com/singularity   (no passwords) ","Since we have not really done a start up before, we are looking at mentor ship as being a primary objective.  Being a B2B company we are not expecting a fast growth trajectory so we are also looking for the initial investment to work full time on this (right now David is 75% time and Alex is about 20%).  We are also looking to secure additional funding after the program to be able to have enough resources to have the staff and money to get the security certifications.

","2-5 years ","We can commit to working on this full time. ","0 employees ","Yes - we can all attend "," ","Chicago Area ","We are different first because we have a platform that integrates collections with the phone system and a dialer in one package that is all cloud based.  The second major difference is we are focus on data security for our clients.  We are also much less expensive than existing systems, and we require no hardware purchases by our clients.

One of the major differences is that we are cloud based, these systems are not and we don't require different PBX and dialer vendors because ours are already built in.  2 of the systems are terminal based and the others are JAVA and .NET fat clients.  ","We are going to offer subscription services to the software either monthly or yearly that we host. We are planning to sell to small and mid sized businesses that need internal collections, new 3rd party debt collection companies.  Internal collections can be hospitals, B2B companies, Governments etc. ","Right now we have 2 potential customers lined up for a private beta.  We plan to expand that by 1).  Approaching companies like the 2 we already have to setup a process for them.  2).  Leverage our industry contacts to find new collection companies just starting out.  3).  We are going to have revenue sharing agreements with a few different people we know in the collections industry and 4).  We hope to use our existing clients for further networking. ","Alpha release ","We have an alpha testing version we are working on internally.  We have about 10 screens we still need to develop before we can launch our private beta with 2 companies we have lined up.  We expect to start the private beta in either December or January depending on staff availability of the 2 companies through the holidays. ","Our next real milestone is our private beta.  We hope to start that around mid November and run it through the first of the year.  We are planning to get feedback on some features and roll them out during the beta period.  Around the first of the year we plan to go into full scale marketing mode.  We will be focusing on key features of our product and try to bring on our first 3rd party debt collection company.

After that we hope to be self sufficient and not need additional funding (not to say that we wouldn't consider it later down the road). ","Right now our challenge is getting the software ready for private beta.  Once the private beta is ready to go then it is going to be getting additional clients.  While we think that we have a strategy that will work (it took minimal effort to get the first 2), we know it is going to take time.  We need to secure additional clients or funding before April otherwise David is going to have to go much more part time than he currently is.  Right now David is working on this about 75% of his time and consulting about 25%.  Alex is working full time and working on trying to find additional potential clients for after launch.

","We are currently developing an app for iOS and Android that provides sports fans, entertainment enthusiasts and memorabilia collectors an easy and free way to verify the authenticity of their collectibles via community consensus. 

1. The Problem

Two companies currently own the autograph authentication market. Unfortunately for collectors, these companies have been a constant subject of controversy since their inception. They often overcharge customers, hire staff who are less than familiar with the industry and authenticate unofficial items for high-volume customers, moving collectors to look for alternatives. 

In today's memorabilia industry, one person has the power to determine a collectible ""fake"", leaving the collector with no real recourse. 

2. The Solution

Exemplr aims to give collectors a voice in this conversation by providing an ever-expanding authentication tool that entrusts the community, over the power of few. 

Our system allows users to submit photos of their favorite collectibles and employ the collector community to vote the item up or down based on consistencies, flow, stroke, and other metrics of the respective autograph. This will be the foundation of forging a system where collectors self-authenticate their own items.

As the community grows, so does the database of community-curated autographs that consumers and collectors can view, favorite, share, and compare at any place and at any time.

With FeedbacK’s Apps when a Do-It-Yourself Learner performs a motion he will receive instant automated coaching instruction via his mobile device.  Our applications use the latest computer vision and machine learning techniques, combined with the video functionality that is already part of our mobile device.  FeedbacK’s initial Apps are for Golf and as we grow we will move to additional markets including other sports, health, fitness, & lifestyle industries. 

Problem – FeedbacK's solutions are for sports participants who don’t want to hire a coach or use an App that only provides data.  FeedbacK’s mobile and online Apps represent a new approach to the health, fitness, sports & lifestyle industries by videoing a motion and providing automated coaching to help the Do-It-Yourself learner improve. 

We are all familiar with sensors and devices that capture data.  The current industry approach is to present that data in the form of dashboards.  The user must interpret the dashboard information and decide what is required to improve.  Unlike our competitors who provide data, FeedbacK’s Apps provide automated coaching instruction. We do this using the latest computer vision and machine learning techniques combined with leveraging the video functionality that is already part of our mobile devices.
The output of the process is automated instruction (not data), just as if a coach or personal trainer was with you, without the expense or scheduling.

Solution - The Automated Coaching Technology consists of three distinct Apps at increasing price points:
•	Collect (voice-controlled mobile app used to capture, review and share video);
•	Analyze (takes the video collected and delivers instruction in your browser at the click of a button); and
•	Instruct (delivers automated Instruction at your practice location using your mobile device).
The FeedbacK Automated Coaching Apps are developed for a particular sports (golf, baseball, tennis, basketball...) In fact, the Automated Coaching technology is adaptable to any activity requiring repeatable motion.
We have launched FeedbacK: Collect for golf - the first of the three Apps that comprise the Automated Coaching Technology.

For the Collect and Instruct products, we have also bundled the app with optional hardware to enhance the user experience and to facilitate eRetail and traditional brick & mortar sales. ","FeedbacK Golf has multiple distribution channels: Online sales through our FeedbacK website; Green Grass sales through golf courses, pro shops, and instructors; eRetail through Amazon and The Golf Warehouse; and Retail stores such as Golf Galaxy, PGA Tour Superstore, and New York Golf Center.

","We're building a platform for independent / unsigned musicians (artists, engineers, producers, and songwriters) that beautifully showcases their works, like a portfolio (songs, videos, lyrics, and photos). There's nothing else like it. It's not just an amazing tool for musicians, but for music fans and professionals too (e.g. artist discovery).

Here's some of our differentiators:

* Portfolio. Marid focuses more on 'selling all of the artist' rather than specific works of theirs. Songs, Videos, Lyrics, and Photos (of independent / unsigned artists) all on one platform.

* Recommendation System.

* Visual Analytics. Amazing data visualizations built with D3.js.

* Better search. Allowing users to find artists with specific skills sets, in specific genres, in specific locations (and more) is ideal.

* Higher Quality Content. Moderators and allowing users to flag content, we will be able to maintain high quality works across the whole platform. Users with unfinished works or low quality music won't be posting content on our platform.

* Not a numbers game.

Candy Lab’s code-based mobile platform, CandyBAR, enables rapid development of custom-branded mobile apps to power events, tourism and civic pride. The patent-pending platform uses rich media, location-based engagement, and augmented reality to immerse users and drive them to intended locales. The result is unmatched user engagement through longer and more frequent interaction with branded assets, delivering a higher ROI than other marketing investments

Rather than simply focus on technological feature advancement, we began the development of CandyBAR from the perspective of our customers - Marketers and Business Owners. Our objective was to design a tool that would provide Marketers with an easy way to both bring rich media engagement to their location-based mobile promotions & campaigns, and drive real-time targeted local traffic to specific locations. Augmented Reality is the tool we've used to accomplish this, not simply a tool to enable ""gimmicks"", like making Santa Claus dance on your coffee cup. Other AR companies have primarily been focused on the gimmick route. "," "," "," ","2 founders "," ","  ","Both founders are working on the startup fulltime.

Barriers to entry are strong with the technology lead built by our GPS accuracy improvements, efficient and high quality augmented reality platform, and the code-based platform built and ready to scale.

Compared with competitors, CandyBAR is 10x more accurate and 3x more engaging.

Our competitors include geo-fenced SMS messaging companies:
Tatango: www.tatango.com/
ThumbVista: www.thumbvista.com/
Moasis: moasisglobal.com/ "," ","We use extensive personal networking to identify and reach customers. Outside the US, we have established leads in Europe, Australia, and the Middle East. Once our automated developers platform is completed, we will ramp up outbound marketing activities to drive demand to our self-service platform. ","Revenue "," ","So far this year we have secured three large ($50K - $115K) customers, including Carnival Cruises (buff.ly/1wcQjwI). Revenue has grown from $45K in 2013 to an expected $800K in 2014 (over $650K already closed)

We're on journey from a services+product business to a scalable product business. Our next milestone in this journey is to finish the development of our automated developers platform by January. This will enable Candy Lab to dramatically increase the available market by making the CandyBAR platform accessible to any business with minimal interaction with us.

We expect to close $800K in revenue in 2014, consisting of a mix of product and services.

"," -Kryptik Music Communities's focus will be on uniting ALL local musicians into an alliance where musicians support each other by going to each others events and inviting their fans as well.  By doing so, they are left fully empowered and able to book venues that would have otherwise been inaccessible to them due to lack of patrons. There's strength in numbers.
 -There will be a uniquely designed system in place that will track which musicians are performing, which musicians are supporting, and based on how supportive they have been by the ""deadline"" it also decides which musicians are now selected to be the paid headlining acts at the upcoming event. There is incentive to support.
 -While only the most supportive musicians get to headline, ALL musicians are guaranteed to perform as openers based on a first register first play basis. This radical inclusion in the community is not something you will find anywhere outside of an open mic. This creates loyalty to a brand that says everyone is welcome and encouraged to participate.
 -The events will be held bi monthly, which means 6 events per year. By graphing Mo state/other states into multiple ""zones"" based on musician population and venues, we'll be able to host hundreds of events simultaneously 6 times per year. Due to the sheer number of events happening around the country simultaneously, Kryptic Music Communities will be seen more as a movement rather than just an event, which will further solidify its branding. "," ","I'm going to have a profound impact on the local music community by leaving them fully empowered to further their careers, full of self expression, and able to be a radical contribution to themselves and each other. It's all about community and sharing. If just one of us isn't empowered, none of us are. ","Lonnie Craigg CEO ","1 founder ","No, I have no experience working a startup.

With KMC, ALL artists no matter their following have a guaranteed performance slot at an upcoming event.

-Booking agents/Venues rely on you, the artist to bring the crowd. KMC's core purpose is to create and bring a crowd to the artists. 

-There will be hundreds of bi monthly events that run simultaneously across all time zones.

-KMC holds the only competition where all artists win. ","Reverbnation.com Is the biggest competitor for Kryptik Music Communities. However, their service is completely different. They only connect artists with venues, agents, and gigs. They do nothing in the realm of creating the audience or uniting artists to form any alliances. There is a sense of radical inclusion in that, all artists no what what genre, following or skill level can upload their music and sell it, but there isn't any offline presence. There is no site offering what KMC will offer. ","-KMC makes money from ticket sales. Musicians and their fans purchase tickets to support other musicians, which in turns supports themselves. Headlining acts get the first $1,000 made off ticket sales per event, KMC gets anything past that 1,000 mark per event.
-KMC will also sell ad space to businesses that are focused on musicians such as guitar center, sam ash, music colleges, music lessons, repair shops, logo designers, t-shirt/merchandise companies etc. ","Ad space on Reverbnation.com, Facebook.com, and a number of smaller music blogs.

","Non-revenue customer traction ","There are 30 bands in each ""zone"", bands have an average of 4 members, assuming each member buys a ticket, assuming each band gets at least 1 fan to buy a ticket, and considering there are exactly 30 bands buying tickets in each zone, just 1 zone will bring in $2,100, minus $1,000 for the headliners. The goal is to have hundreds of zones across the country and to have bands bring more that 1 fan. ","The next milestone is to have the backend of the website constructed. The front end is already complete, I just need its functionality to be in place. Upon receiving funding, the site will be in Beta testing in 6 months.

Right now they go bar hopping until they find a spot that’s packed.  You could spend your whole night going to dead bars, or places with the wrong vibe, before you find a good spot. Especially if you’re traveling and in a city you don’t know well.   ","Facebook could easily rip this idea off. Foursquare/Swarm are similar to this idea but they only show you where your friends are. This is more about sharing where you are at with everyone in your local area. It’s a completely different thing than what Facebook/Foursquare/Swarm are doing which is completely friend based. There are other “night life” apps out there but nothing anywhere near how “cool and easy and useful” this product is on a global scale.  ","The primary income will be from in-app purchases of chat-requests (Linkedin’s model) and retail advertising for bars/clubs (Yelp's model). 

I've hypothesized the potential user growth, revenue growth and funding needed to reach revenues challenging that of Yelp.  Over $20M/month in potential revenue.   ","Facebook Advertising, Celebrities, and our Affiliate program are the 3 best strategies we have right now and we've proven it works in Albuquerque to a degree. To combat the chicken/egg problem were adding features that make the app incredibly useful before there are any users. As an example, we are adding the most popular events to the location pages in our current product. The other idea is to launch city by city, focusing our efforts until we reach critical mass, then going to the next city.

Users will get points by checkins, reviewing, sharing photos, or sharing anything involving the business community, to Basenji and other social networks. A user community is born, where they collect points, and a business community that use points to exchange for rewards, creating a new marketing tool. Another difference is that BasenjiApp is working with beacon technology to enable business communicate with users directly. (let the business speak literally).

","Unlike other freelance exchanges that use a proposal system, our “Talent Recommendation Engine” uses both quantitative and qualitative data to match clients with their four most compatible provider options. By aligning client and provider incentives through a merit based system that establishes price integrity, we not only help our clients find the best provider on our site, but offer a class of freelancer far superior to what can be found on today’s exchanges.

The following features differentiate our exchange from others:

Invitation-Only Matching - Most exchanges employ an open job proposal process that results in a deluge of job proposals received. Our Engine suggests the four best providers for a particular job, dramatically reducing the risk of making the wrong hire.

High-Quality Standards - Today’s exchanges are open to any provider, which means quality standards suffer. Our Engine contains three levels of provider quality control. 

Meritocratic Tier Structure - Our provider tier structure validates the prices providers can charge for their services and creates a clear path to higher earnings potential. For clients, they provide optionality at a range of prices.

Provider Focus - We are creating an egalitarian platform where both sides are given the tools to make outsourcing work easier.

Data-Driven Approach - We embrace big data by capturing on-site metrics such as response rates, milestone completion rates, and financial performance indicators like ROI.

","The founders of Transaide spent years researching the common traits of successful businesses. One of those traits was the ability to build strategic partnerships.  Every great business had to learn to search and work with other complementary businesses to broaden their market reach and foster growth.  No one company can do everything on their own and finding strategic partners is critical to the success and growth of any venture.
The problem is strategic business partnerships are still created on the golf course or over a glass of wine. The team at Transaide developed a solution where businesses can discover complementary strategic partners online. After years of research and experience in consulting we developed a list of core traits required for a successful partnership. Using these core traits we are working on developing a Complementary Good Matching Engine (C.G.M.E) which will match and suggest partners that are best suited for them.  Finding a strategic partner is only part of the problem the other problem is leveraging the new found partnership to grow your business. We’ve all heard the horror stories of failed strategic partnerships and the team at Transaide wanted to build tools that will grant businesses the highest probability of success. This is why we working with partners to offer the best loyalty, cross marketing and consumer engagement tools.

Think Tinder/Snapchat meets deals.

We're leveraging social data and breathing some life into the deal world, and doing so with a business model that is disruptive for this space. Rather than taking a margin-crushing commission or fee on each item sold, we leverage out user experience to charge by the impression. This CPM model (commonly seen in online display advertising) has attracted unprecedented vendor buy-in from leading brands like Nike and Under Armour.

We also extend our reach via a patent-pending, proprietary ad format called Benji. Benji will be the new standard for e-commerce product re-targeting while also being the most effective advertisement for the benjamin mobile app.

The result is the first true merchandise network. We'll be able to take any vendor's merchandise and distribute it across a targeted network of web and mobile channels.","CPM business model, vendor partnerships (NFL Shop, Ray Ban, Under Armour, more), unique user experience.","Desktop, Mobile/Tablet (Android), Mobile/Tablet (iOS)"," ","Total: USD 315750"," "," "," ","Yes ",1000000,USD,10000000,USD,"Seed "," ",,Ephecom.pptx,Finalized,"Andrew J.",Chapin,222938,"Mountain View","United States","Business development, Harvard, Feathr, Color Labs, Microsoft","Business Strategy,Inbound,Sales Growth"," www.linkedin.com/pub/andrew-j-chapin/15/645/741/;andrewjchapin;https://www.facebook.com/andrew.chapin;benjaminapp.co",andrew@benjaminapp.co,"Business Founder",andrewjameschapin,6175812998,"I was the first business hire at Feathr - I took the company from revenue-zero to a $1m run-rate in less than 11 months."," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," "," ","benjamin ","andrew@benjaminapp.co ","6175812998 ","Other "," ","benjamin gives the end-user two things: heavy discounts on the products that they love, and sixty seconds to decide whether to buy or pass.  ","Our platform matches the two parties through the power of big data (acquired via the social graph, app usage, as well as light/basic in-app surveys) and machine learning. Offers are presented in an engaging way: one at a time, and with sixty seconds to decide whether to buy or pass.  This introduces an element of fun – breathing life into the bargain-shopping experience.

For the vendors, we're offering direct access to the palm of a qualified buyer's hand, and we're doing so in a way that is different than Groupon or Living Social. Other deal sites use commission or fee based models but our revenue will be generated via a CPM model similar to online display advertising. This is in the best interest of all parties as it is cheap for the vendor and encourages our customers to load much more product onto the platform. "," ","February to May will be a very exciting and interesting time for us, as we launch publicly in January and will be looking to scale. This time will certainly involve a lot of learning. We'll be figuring out what our users like and how we can best meet those needs. This will also include our first major external hires. ","Andrew Chapin, CEO

The user will enjoy our engaging interface 

On the vendor side, we have a business model different from Groupon or Living Social -- rather than asking for a commission or a fee, we use a CPM model that assists vendors in maintaining their margins.  ","As far as the end-user side is concerned: 
Groupon - groupon.com
Living Social - livingsocial.com
Gilt - gilt.com
Woot - woot.com

However, we are competing for company ad dollars which makes us competition for companies like:
Facebook - facebook.com
Google - google.com ","Revenue is generated via CPM, which is in the best interest of all parties. The CPM model is typical (vendors understand it), it is performance-based (vendor incentive), it does not interfere with the quality of our offering, it is easy to evaluate and track, and it's easy to evaluate the competitive landscape with a common core metric. We sell to anybody who sells products online. ","At present, we leverage LinkedIn to find warm introductions to marketing professionals at larger e-commerce companies.
